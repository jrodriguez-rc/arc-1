# ARC-1 Tool Reference

Complete documentation for all MCP tools available in ARC-1.

ARC-1 exposes **12 intent-based tools** designed for AI agents. Instead of 200+ individual tools (one per object type per operation), ARC-1 groups by *intent* with a `type` parameter for routing. This keeps the LLM's tool selection simple, with the schema payload guarded by CI budgets and a hyperfocused 1-tool mode for tight context windows.

Experimental aggregate multi-target mode can add one catalog utility, `SAPTargets`. It is not one
of the 12 core intent tools and is never exposed on `/mcp` or a pinned target route.

**Error intelligence:** ARC-1 enriches many SAP ADT failures with concise, actionable hints (for example lock conflicts, enqueue issues, missing authorizations, and transport/corrNr problems). Hints can include SAP transaction references like `SM12` (locks), `SU53` (authorization), and `SE09` (transport checks) to speed up troubleshooting.

---

## SAPTargets (aggregate multi-target only)

List the SAP targets that can be selected through `/multi/mcp`. The tool takes no `target` parameter
and does not contact SAP. Listing a target proves only that ARC-1 accepted its configuration; it
does not prove that the current user's SAP identity can access it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | No | Case-insensitive filter over target IDs and descriptions. Admin results also match destination name, status, code, and message. Maximum 160 characters. |
| `offset` | integer | No | Admin-only diagnostic-page offset. Follow `diagnosticNextOffset` when the bounded result is truncated. |

- A reader sees `SAPTargets` only when more than one target is active. Its compact response contains
  target IDs, descriptions, and `identity` (`per-user` or `shared`).
- An Admin sees it with zero, one, or many targets, including paged, secret-safe registry and
  quarantine diagnostics. Destination URLs, credentials, tokens, certificates, and raw Cloud
  Connector location IDs are never returned. It remains available when registry discovery fails.
- It is never listed on `/<SYSTEM>/<CLIENT>/mcp`, an alias-pinned route, or the explicitly configured
  single-target `/mcp` route.

See [Multi-System Setup](multi-target-setup.md#target-catalog-tool) for the response shape, privacy
boundary, and target-selection behavior.

## SAPRead

Read any SAP ABAP object.

Use `SAPRead` when you need exact raw source, one method body, grep output, inactive drafts, revision history, or metadata. For object understanding questions such as "what does this class do?" or pre-change/spec/review orientation, start with `SAPContext(action="deps")`; it includes the object's KTD when available and avoids reading full source before the model knows what matters.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Yes | Object type (see below; includes `AUTH`, `FEATURE_TOGGLE`, `ENHO`, `VERSIONS`, `VERSION_SOURCE` on on-prem systems, and the server-driven objects `DSFD`/`DESD`/`EVTB`/`EVTO`/`DTSC`/`CSNM`/`COTA`/`DTDC`/`UIAD` where the system advertises them — ABAP Platform 2025 / 8.16+, plus `EVTB` on S/4HANA 2023) |
| `name` | string | No | Object name (e.g., `ZTEST_PROGRAM`, `ZCL_ORDER`, `MARA`) |
| `action` | string | No | `"diff"` — return a unified diff between two source versions on this system (only the hunks, not two full sources), using `from`/`to`. Source types only: `PROG, CLAS, INTF, FUNC, FUGR, INCL, DDLS, DCLS, BDEF, SRVD, DDLX, TABL` (CDS views are `DDLS`; classic DDIC `VIEW` is unsupported — it has no plain-text source). Note: SAP only snapshots a version on transport *release*, so `from`/`to` revision ids are sparse — `active` vs `inactive` (pending unactivated changes) is the most reliable use. |
| `from` | string | No | For `action="diff"`: OLD side — `"active"` (default), `"inactive"`, a revision id (from a VERSIONS response), or its canonical source/revision URI. URI inputs use the same endpoint, authority, traversal, query, fragment, and control-character checks as `versionUri`. |
| `to` | string | No | For `action="diff"`: NEW side — defaults to `"inactive"`. Same accepted values as `from`. |
| `fromLabel` | string | No | For `action="diff"`: optional display label for the OLD side in the summary and patch header, e.g. `DNT-6-6: Validate discounts (DS7K900123)`. Does not affect source resolution. |
| `toLabel` | string | No | For `action="diff"`: optional display label for the NEW side in the summary and patch header, e.g. `active` or `inactive draft`. Does not affect source resolution. |
| `format` | string | No | Output format: `"text"` (default) or `"structured"`. For `action="diff"`, structured returns a machine-readable diff envelope; for ordinary reads, structured is supported for CLAS only (see below). |
| `include` | string | No | For CLAS: `main`, `testclasses`, `definitions`, `implementations`, `macros`. With `method=`, an explicit include selects that exact source (including `main`) before method extraction. For DDLS: `elements` (extract CDS view elements). |
| `method` | string | No | For CLAS: method name to read (e.g., `get_name`), a qualified local-class method (e.g., `lhc_travel~accept`), or `*` to list methods. With no `include=`, `lhc_*`/`lcl_*` automatically read `implementations`, `ltc_*` reads `testclasses`, and other names read MAIN. |
| `grep` | string | No | Case-insensitive regex; returns only matching source lines (+3 lines of context, with line numbers) instead of the full object — token-efficient search over source-bearing types (`PROG, CLAS, INTF, FUNC, FUGR, INCL, DDLS, DCLS, BDEF, SRVD, SRVB, SKTD/KTD, DDLX, TABL, VIEW`). For CLAS, matches are annotated with the owning class/method; combine with `include=` to scope a section, but not with `method=`. Falls back to a literal search when the pattern is not valid regex. |
| `expand_includes` | boolean | No | For FUGR: expand include source inline |
| `group` | string | No | For FUNC: function group name |
| `versionUri` | string | No | For VERSION_SOURCE: canonical source/revision URI from a VERSIONS response (`revisions[].uri`). Only known source endpoint shapes are accepted; unrelated ADT endpoints, absolute URLs, authority changes, dot segments, queries, fragments, controls, encoded backslashes, and ambiguous nested encodings are rejected. Encoded slashes remain valid inside namespaced ABAP object names. |
| `maxRows` | number | No | For TABLE_CONTENTS/TABLE_QUERY: requested row cap (default 100). Known TABLE_CONTENTS limitation on 758: SAP returns `N+1`; use TABLE_QUERY or cap client-side when an exact maximum matters. |
| `maxResults` | number | No | For DEVC: maximum package objects to list (default 200, clamped to 1–1000). SAP may truncate larger packages at the requested limit. |
| `sqlFilter` | string | No | Legacy TABLE_CONTENTS condition. Do not rely on it for portable automation: the 758 endpoint expects a different SELECT-shaped payload, so condition-only filters are unusable there. Prefer TABLE_QUERY `where`. |
| `columns` | array | No | For TABLE_QUERY: fields to project; omit for all columns. Example: `["MANDT","MATNR"]`. |
| `where` | array | No | For TABLE_QUERY: ANDed `{field,op,value?}` conditions. Operators: `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`. IN values are bare comma-separated values; ARC-1 quotes/escapes them. On 758 use `<>`, because accepted `!=` is sent unchanged and SAP rejects it. |
| `objectType` | string | No | For API_STATE: SAP object type (CLAS, INTF, PROG, FUGR, etc.) — auto-detected from name if omitted |
| `version` | string | No | Source version: `active` (default), `inactive`, or `auto`. Applies to source-bearing types (PROG, CLAS, INTF, FUNC, INCL, DDLS, DCLS, DDLX, BDEF, SRVD, FUGR, SRVB, SKTD/KTD, TABL, VIEW). See [Active vs Inactive Source](#active-vs-inactive-source) below. |
| `force_refresh` | boolean | No | For source reads: bypass the cached source AND the inactive-list cache before reading. Use when you know the object changed outside ARC-1 in a way conditional GET can't catch. |
| `includeSignature` | boolean | No | For `FUNC` only. When `true`, response is JSON `{source, signature: {importing[], exporting[], changing[], tables[], exceptions[], raising[]}, processingType?, updateTaskKind?}` — each parameter parsed into `{kind, name, type, byValue?, default?, optional?}`; `processingType` reports `normal`/`rfc`/`update` (a metadata read, so it may add `propertiesError` instead if that GET fails). Default `false` (returns plain source body). See [SAPWrite for FUNC](#sapwrite-for-func-create-update-with-structured-parameters) for the round-trip. |

**Supported types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `PROG` | Program source |
| `CLAS` | Class source |
| `INTF` | Interface source |
| `FUNC` | Function module source |
| `FUGR` | Function group structure (function modules + includes). Uses `/functions/groups/{g}/objectstructure`, falling back to the generic `/repository/objectstructure` on releases that don't ship it (NW 7.50/7.51). |
| `INCL` | Include source |
| `DDLS` | CDS view source |
| `DCLS` | CDS access control source (authorization rules for CDS views) |
| `DDLX` | CDS metadata extension (UI annotations for Fiori Elements) |
| `BDEF` | Behavior definition |
| `SRVD` | Service definition |
| `SRVB` | Service binding (structured JSON: OData version, binding type, publish status) |
| `SKTD` / `KTD` | Knowledge Transfer Document attached to an ABAP object. Returns Markdown decoded from the ADT XML envelope, one `## <node id>` section per documented node when the object has several (BDEF entities, savers, actions, functions, …). When there is anything to show, the response ends with a read-only metadata trailer behind an HTML-comment marker line: the short text of each node that has one, as `<name> [TYPE]: text`, then — when SAP has pre-created nodes that nobody documented yet — a compact index of their ids grouped by type, so any of them can be documented with `SAPWrite` by adding a `## <name>` section. `SAPWrite` ignores everything from the marker line on, so a whole `SAPRead` result can be pasted back as `source` unmodified. `KTD` is a friendly alias; `SKTD` remains the canonical SAP object type. |
| `TABL` | DDIC TABL — covers both transparent tables (T000-style) and DDIC structures (BAPIRET2-style). Returns CDS-like source. ARC-1 auto-resolves the URL: tries `/sap/bc/adt/ddic/tables/{name}` first, falls back to `/sap/bc/adt/ddic/structures/{name}` on 404. There is no separate `STRU` type — `TABL` is the canonical short type for both, mirroring TADIR `R3TR TABL` and abapGit conventions. |
| `TTYP` | DDIC table type (on-prem only). Returns `{name, description, rowType, rowTypeKind, accessType, keyKind}`. Written via `SAPWrite(type="TTYP")` — the create POSTs a CHAR shell and a follow-up PUT sets the real row type. |
| `VIEW` | DDIC view |
| `DOMA` | Domain metadata (structured JSON: data type, length, fixed values, value table) |
| `DTEL` | Data element metadata (structured JSON: type, labels, search help) |
| `AUTH` | Authorization field metadata (structured JSON: role name, check table, domain, conversion exit, org-level info) |
| `FEATURE_TOGGLE` | Feature toggle states (structured JSON: toggle state per system from SAP switch framework). Renamed from `FTG2` in audit Plan B (docs/research/abap-types/types/ftg2.md) — `FTG2` still accepted as deprecated alias for one minor release with stderr warning. |
| `ENHO` | Enhancement implementation metadata (structured JSON: BAdI technology, referenced object, implementation classes) |
| `VERSIONS` | Revision history for an ABAP object. Returns JSON: `{ object: { name, type }, revisions: [{ id, author, timestamp, transport?, uri }] }`. Optional `include` for CLAS and `group` for FUNC. On-prem only. |
| `VERSION_SOURCE` | Source code at a specific revision. Pass `versionUri` from a VERSIONS response. Returns raw source text. On-prem only. |
| `DESD` | CDS Logical External Schema — **server-driven object** (generic AFF read). Returns JSON: parsed `blue:blueSource` metadata (name, type, description, package, language, version, …) + the AFF JSON source. SAP_BASIS 8.16+ (ABAP Platform 2025), discovery-gated. |
| `EVTB` | RAP Event Binding — server-driven object. JSON metadata + AFF JSON source (`boName`, `boOperation`, `events[]`). Available on S/4HANA 2023 (758) **and** 8.16+. |
| `EVTO` | RAP Event Object — server-driven object. 8.16+. |
| `DTSC` | CDS Static Cache (table-entity buffer) — server-driven object. JSON metadata + **DDL text** source (`define static cache …`). 8.16+. |
| `CSNM` | Core Schema Notation Model (CSN) — server-driven object. 8.16+. |
| `COTA` | Communication Target — server-driven object. 8.16+. |
| `DSFD` | CDS Scalar Function Definition — server-driven object. JSON metadata + **DDL text** source (`define scalar function …`). Available on S/4HANA 2023 (758) and 8.16+. |
| `UIAD` | Launchpad App Descriptor Item (LADI) — server-driven object. SAP_BASIS 8.16+. The successor to the deprecated tile/target-mapping model and the unit SAP Build Work Zone content exposure v2 federates. AFF JSON source carries `generalInformation` (appType, catalogId, transaction), `navigation` (targetMappingId, semanticObject, action, form factors) and `tiles[]`. Find names via `SAPRead type=DEVC` on the owning package (listed as `UIAD/TYP` — pass the bare `UIAD`). |
| `DTDC` | CDS Dynamic Cache — server-driven object with its OWN metadata format (`<dtdc:dtdcSource>`, not `blue:blueSource`). JSON metadata + **DDL text** source (`define dynamic cache …`). Available on S/4HANA 2023 (758) and 8.16+. |
| `TRAN` | Transaction metadata (structured JSON: code, description, program) |
| `SOBJ` | BOR business object (list methods, or read specific method with `method` param) |
| `BSP` | BSP/UI5 filestore. List apps without `name`; browse or read with `name="<app>"` and optional case-sensitive `include="<path>"`. `name="<app>/<path>"` is also accepted. |
| `API_STATE` | API release state (clean core compliance — contract states C0-C4, successor info) |
| `TABLE_CONTENTS` | Legacy table preview. Useful for an unfiltered sample; filtering and exact row caps are backend-dependent (see parameters above). Prefer `TABLE_QUERY` for deterministic structured projection/filtering. |
| `TABLE_QUERY` | Structured table/CDS query through data preview (`columns`, `where`, `maxRows`); requires the data-preview gate. |
| `DEVC` | Package contents |
| `SYSTEM` | System info (SID, release, kernel) |
| `COMPONENTS` | Installed software components |
| `MSAG` | Message class metadata (structured JSON with `number`, `shortText`, `longText` per message). `MSAG` is the canonical TADIR R3TR short type (added in audit Plan B — docs/research/abap-types/types/msag.md). |
| `MESSAGES` | Deprecated alias for `MSAG`. Still accepted for one minor release with stderr warning; use `MSAG` going forward. |
| `TEXT_ELEMENTS` | Program text elements |
| `VARIANTS` | Program variants |
| `INACTIVE_OBJECTS` | List all objects pending activation for the calling user (no `name` needed). Returns rich metadata: `name`, `type`, `uri`, `description?`, `user`, `deleted`, `transport`, `parentTransport`. |

**Structured format (CLAS only):**

When `format="structured"` is used with CLAS type, the response is a JSON object with:
- `metadata` — class metadata (description, language, category, package, fixPointArithmetic, abapLanguageVersion)
- `main` — main class source code
- `testclasses` — test class source (or null if none)
- `definitions` — local definitions (or null)
- `implementations` — local implementations (or null)
- `macros` — macros (or null)

This is useful when you need to understand class structure or separate test code from production code.

SAPRead(type="VERSION_SOURCE", versionUri="/sap/bc/adt/programs/programs/ZARC1_TEST_REPORT/source/main/versions/20260410185851/00000/content") — fetch source at one revision
SAPRead(type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER", action="diff")                       — diff active vs your inactive draft (pending changes)
SAPRead(type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER", action="diff", from="00001", to="active") — diff a revision against the active version

SAPRead(type="API_STATE", name="CL_SALV_TABLE")              — check if class is released for ABAP Cloud
SAPRead(type="API_STATE", name="IF_HTTP_CLIENT")              — check interface release state
SAPRead(type="API_STATE", name="MARA", objectType="TABL")     — check table with explicit type
SAPRead(type="TABLE_CONTENTS", name="MARA", maxRows=10) — legacy unfiltered preview; 758 may return 11 rows
SAPRead(type="TABLE_QUERY", name="MARA", columns=["MANDT","MATNR"], where=[{field:"MANDT",op:"=",value:"001"}], maxRows=10)
SAPRead(type="SYSTEM")
SAPRead(type="INACTIVE_OBJECTS")                 — list objects pending activation
```

For `TABLE_QUERY` on 758, use `op:"<>"` for inequality. Although the current input schema also accepts
`!=`, ARC-1 sends it unchanged and that backend rejects it; normalization is tracked as a focused
follow-up.

### Active vs Inactive Source

Source-bearing types accept a `version` parameter to choose between the activated source and the calling user's unactivated draft:

| `version` | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| `active` (default) | Reads the last activated source. If the user has an unactivated draft (created in Eclipse/SE80, not yet activated), the response is prefixed with a one-line note flagging the draft so the LLM knows there's a gap and can re-read with `version='inactive'` if appropriate. |
| `inactive` | Reads the user's draft directly. If no draft exists, SAP falls back to the active source and the response is prefixed with: *"No inactive draft exists for this object on the server. Returning the active version."* |
| `auto` | Resolves client-side via the cached inactive-objects list: returns the draft if one exists, otherwise active. No warning is prefixed (the caller explicitly opted into "show me my view"). |

The default preserves all existing caller behaviour; `version` is an opt-in extension.

```
SAPRead(type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER")                          — active source (default)
SAPRead(type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER", version="inactive")       — your draft
SAPRead(type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER", version="auto")           — draft if it exists, else active
```

### Cache Behaviour

ARC-1 caches every source read with the SAP-emitted `ETag`. On the next read, ARC-1 sends `If-None-Match` so the server itself confirms freshness:

- **`304 Not Modified`** → cached body is still authoritative; response is prefixed with `[cached:revalidated]`.
- **`200 OK` with new body and ETag** → cache is replaced; no prefix on the response.
- **`404` / `410`** → cache entry is invalidated and the error is propagated.

This means external writes (Eclipse activations, gCTS pulls, abapGit imports) are caught automatically — there's no staleness window. To force a fresh fetch and bypass the cache for one read, pass `force_refresh: true`.

The full caching architecture (per-version cache keys, conditional GET, dependency-graph caching, inactive-list session cache, write invalidation) is documented in [Caching System](caching.md).

## SAPSearch

Search for ABAP objects by name pattern, exact object-directory names, or ABAP source text.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | No | Search pattern (e.g., `ZCL_ORDER*`, `Z*TEST*`), source text, or comma/whitespace-separated names for `tadir_lookup` |
| `maxResults` | number | No | Maximum results (default 100) |
| `searchType` | string | No | `object` (default, name search), `tadir_lookup` (exact cross-package object lookup), or `source_code` (text search within ABAP source) |
| `names` | array | No | For `tadir_lookup`: exact object names to resolve across packages |
| `objectTypes` | array | No | For `tadir_lookup`: optional ADT/TADIR type filters such as `TABL`, `DDLS`, `BDEF`, `SRVB`, `CLAS/OC` |
| `objectType` | string | No | For `source_code`: filter by object type. For `tadir_lookup`: single type filter |
| `source` | string | No | For `tadir_lookup` only: `adt` (default), `db`, or `both`. `db`/`both` require the `sql` scope and `SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true`. See [TADIR lookup `source` modes](#tadir-lookup-source-modes) below. |
| `packageName` | string | No | For `source_code` search: filter by package |

**Returns:** Object type, name, package, and description for each match. `tadir_lookup` groups exact matches by requested name and includes a `missing` list. Source code search also returns line numbers and code snippets. When `source='both'` reveals divergence between the ADT and DB views, the response adds a `splitBrain: [name, ...]` array and a `warnings: [...]` array explaining each diverging name.

**Examples:**
```
SAPSearch(query="ZCL_ORDER*")
SAPSearch(query="Z*INVOICE*", maxResults=20)
SAPSearch(searchType="tadir_lookup", names=["ZDM_PROJECT_D","ZR_DM_PROJECT"], objectTypes=["TABL","BDEF"])
SAPSearch(searchType="tadir_lookup", query="ZDM_PROJECT_D ZUI_DM_PROJECTS_O4")
SAPSearch(searchType="tadir_lookup", names=["ZR_OLD_VIEW"], source="both")   // detect TADIR ghosts after a failed delete
SAPSearch(query="SY-SUBRC", searchType="source_code")
SAPSearch(query="SELECT * FROM mara", searchType="source_code", objectType="CLAS", packageName="ZDEV")
```

**Umlaut handling:** Object name queries containing non-ASCII characters (ä, ö, ü, ß) are automatically transliterated to ASCII equivalents (AE, OE, UE, SS). SAP object names are ASCII-only. Source code search preserves non-ASCII characters.

**Field names:** If searching for a field/column name (e.g., MATNR, BUKRS), use SAPQuery against DD03L instead — SAPSearch only searches object names.

**TADIR lookup:** Use `searchType="tadir_lookup"` for reset/create preflights that need to know whether objects exist anywhere, regardless of package. The default `source='adt'` uses ADT repository quick search, which avoids long `IN (...)` parser limits and works in read/search-only configurations. The endpoint deliberately filters out TADIR rows that don't resolve to a live workbench resource, so orphan/ghost entries (left behind by aborted create/delete cycles) are invisible to the default path — see the source modes section below.

### TADIR lookup source modes

| `source` | Underlying call | Scope required | When to use |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| `adt` (default) | `GET /sap/bc/adt/repository/informationsystem/search?operation=quickSearch&query=...` (one per name) | `read` | Default; workbench-resolvable objects only. Skips TADIR ghost rows by design. |
| `db` | `POST /sap/bc/adt/datapreview/freestyle` with `SELECT pgmid, object, obj_name, devclass FROM tadir WHERE obj_name IN (…)` | `sql` (server-side: `SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true`) | One round-trip for any number of names — much faster for large lists, and surfaces orphan TADIR rows the ADT route hides. |
| `both` | Parallel `adt` + `db` calls; merge by `(base type, name)` with dedupe | `sql` | Explicit split-brain detection. Returns `splitBrain: [name, ...]` and a `warnings` array when the two sources disagree (e.g. a TADIR ghost from an aborted create/delete). |

Every match in the result set is stamped with an `_origin: 'adt' | 'db'` field so callers can colour-code or filter rows by provenance. The `'db'` path also covers legacy SEGW types (`IWSV`/`IWMO`/`IWPR`) that the ADT info-system does not return; the URL is left empty for types that aren't addressable via a single ADT base URL (e.g. function modules, which need the parent group).

**Source code search availability:** Not available on all SAP systems. Requires SICF service activation. If unavailable, falls back with an error suggesting SAPQuery as an alternative.

## SAPWrite

Create or update ABAP source code. Handles lock/modify/unlock automatically.

> **NetWeaver < 7.51:** ADT writes over HTTP require a stateful session that older releases
> don't honor, so writes fail with `423 invalid lock handle` until the `abapfs_extensions`
> enhancement is installed on the SAP system. This is *not* SAP Note 2727890 (a separate
> narrow bug). See [SAP trial setup → Writes fail with 423](sap-trial-setup.md) (423 troubleshooting section). S/4HANA (≥ 7.51) is unaffected.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | Yes | `create`, `update`, `delete`, `edit_method`, `edit_unit` (on-prem), `edit_class_definition`, `add_method`, `edit_method_signature`, `delete_method`, `change_method_visibility`, `batch_create`, `scaffold_rap_handlers`, `generate_behavior_implementation`, or `edit_text_symbols`. `edit_unit` surgically replaces one FORM or MODULE in a PROG/INCL; see [Procedural unit surgery](#procedural-unit-surgery). The class-section surgery actions (`edit_class_definition`, `add_method`, `edit_method_signature`, `delete_method`, `change_method_visibility`) are token-efficient edits to a global class without re-sending `/source/main`. See [Class-section surgery](#class-section-surgery) below. `edit_text_symbols` writes a global class's text pool — see [Class text symbols](#class-text-symbols). |
| `type` | string | No | `PROG`, `CLAS`, `INTF`, `FUNC`, `FUGR`, `INCL`, `DDLS`, `DCLS`, `DDLX`, `BDEF`, `SRVD`, `SRVB`, `SKTD`/`KTD`, `TABL`, `TTYP` (on-prem), `TABL/DT`, `TABL/DS`, `DOMA`, `DTEL`, `MSAG` (for single object actions; availability is adapted for BTP vs. on-prem), plus the server-driven objects `DESD`/`EVTB`/`DTSC`/`CSNM`/`EVTO`/`COTA`/`DSFD`/`DTDC`/`UIAD` (see [Server-driven object writes](#server-driven-object-writes)). Slash/case aliases are auto-normalized (e.g., `CLAS/OC` or `clas` → `CLAS`; `KTD` → `SKTD`). |
| `group` | string | No | For `FUNC`: parent function-group name. **Required for FUNC create** (the FUGR must already exist — create it first via `SAPWrite type=FUGR`). Auto-resolved via search for FUNC update/delete if omitted. For `INCL`: addresses a structural include inside this function group; supported by `update` and `edit_unit`. Ignored for other types. |
| `rowType` | string | No | `TTYP` create/update (on-prem only): the row type — a built-in ABAP type (`STRING`, `I`, …) or a DDIC type name such as `BAPIRET2`. |
| `rowTypeKind` | string | No | `TTYP` only: `builtin` or `structure`. Omit it and ARC-1 infers from `rowType`; pass it explicitly when SAP knows a built-in type ARC-1 has not enumerated. |
| `processingType` | string | No | On-prem `FUNC` create only: `normal`, `rfc` (Remote-Enabled), or `update`. Omit it to preserve the legacy SAP-default behavior. |
| `updateTaskKind` | string | No | Required when `processingType="update"`: `startImmediate` (V1 restartable), `immediateStartNoRestart` (V1 non-restartable), or `startDelayed` (V2). Rejected for normal/RFC modules. |
| `parameters` | array | No | FUNC structured signature: `{kind,name,type?,byValue?,default?,optional?}` rows for importing/exporting/changing/tables/exceptions/raising. ARC-1 builds and splices the clauses; omit to send `source` verbatim. |
| `name` | string | No | Object name (for single object actions) |
| `source` | string | No | ABAP source code. For `create`/`update`: full source body. For `edit_method`: new method body. For `edit_unit`: the complete replacement `FORM … ENDFORM.` or `MODULE … ENDMODULE.` block. For `edit_class_definition` without `include=`: ONLY the new global `CLASS … DEFINITION … ENDCLASS.` block (~10–80 lines instead of full class). For `edit_class_definition` with `include=`: the FULL replacement body of that class-local include; for `include="testclasses"` this normally includes both local `CLASS ltc_* DEFINITION` and `CLASS ltc_* IMPLEMENTATION`. For `edit_method_signature`: ONLY the new METHODS clause for one method (~1–5 lines). Not used by `add_method`/`delete_method`/`change_method_visibility` — pass the method clause/name and target visibility via `method`/`visibility` instead. |
| `include` | string | No | For CLAS write actions `update`, `edit_method`, and `edit_class_definition`: write a class-local include (`definitions`, `implementations`, `macros`, or `testclasses`) instead of `/source/main`. Omit this parameter for main class source updates. `add_method`/`edit_method_signature`/`delete_method`/`change_method_visibility` operate on the global class `/source/main` only and reject `include=`. Include writes create an inactive draft; verify with `SAPRead(version="inactive")` until activation. NOTE: `edit_class_definition` with `include=` skips the symmetry refuse-policy (cross-include validation is not performed; rely on `SAPActivate` to catch breaks). **Auto-init:** whole-include writes (`update` and `edit_class_definition` with `include=`) create the target include automatically if it does not exist yet — notably `testclasses` (CCAU) on a freshly-created class. No separate init step or user-supplied lock handle is needed; the success message notes when ARC-1 initialized it. |
| `method` | string | No | For `edit_method`/`edit_method_signature`/`delete_method`/`change_method_visibility`: method NAME (e.g., `"get_name"`, `"zif_order~process"`, `"lhc_project~approve_project"`). For `add_method`: the full METHODS CLAUSE as ABAP source (e.g., `"METHODS greet IMPORTING who TYPE string RETURNING VALUE(r) TYPE string."`). |
| `unit` | string | No | For on-prem `edit_unit`: case-insensitive FORM or MODULE name (for example `"PROCESS_ORDERS"` or `"STATUS_0100"`). |
| `visibility` | string | No | For `add_method`: target visibility section — `public` (default), `protected`, or `private`. For `change_method_visibility`: target visibility section (required). The section header must already exist in the DEFINITION block; if not, ARC-1 refuses with a hint to use `edit_class_definition` first. |
| `abstract` | boolean | No | For `add_method`: when `true`, only the METHODS clause is inserted into DEFINITION — no `METHOD/ENDMETHOD` stub is added to IMPLEMENTATION. Default `false`. |
| `bdefName` | string | No | For `scaffold_rap_handlers`: interface BDEF name used to derive required handler signatures. For `generate_behavior_implementation`: optional override; default discovery reads the class metadata's `<class:rootEntityRef>` to locate the BDEF automatically. |
| `autoApply` | boolean | No | For `scaffold_rap_handlers`: when `true`, create missing `lhc_*` skeletons, inject missing signatures plus empty method stubs into the behavior pool, and write back. Not used by `generate_behavior_implementation` (which always applies; use `dryRun=true` there to preview). |
| `targetAlias` | string | No | For `scaffold_rap_handlers` and `generate_behavior_implementation`: optional RAP entity alias filter (scaffold only one alias/handler class) |
| `activate` | boolean | No | For `generate_behavior_implementation`: when `true` (default), runs `SAPActivate` on the class after writing. When `false`, only the source is written. Activation failures matching the well-known `Local classes of CL_ABAP_BEHAVIOR_HANDLER…` stale-active coupling do **not** throw — they return `activation.success=false` with a guided recovery hint so the just-written CCDEF/CCIMP source remains useful. |
| `dryRun` | boolean | No | For `generate_behavior_implementation`: when `true`, runs discovery + cross-validation + scaffold planning and returns the report **without** writing or activating. Use this to preview what would change. |
| `description` | string | No | Object description for `create` (defaults to name if omitted, max 60 chars) |
| `package` | string | No | Package for new objects (default `$TMP`) |
| `transport` | string | No | Transport request number. For `update` and `delete`, if omitted ARC-1 auto-uses the correction number returned by the SAP lock (if any). Explicit value takes precedence. |
| `lintBeforeWrite` | boolean | No | Override server lint setting for this call (`false` to bypass pre-write lint) |
| `preflightBeforeWrite` | boolean | No | Override deterministic RAP preflight checks for this call (`false` to bypass TABL/BDEF/DDLX/DDLS static checks) |
| `checkBeforeWrite` | boolean | No | Override the server SAP-side pre-write syntax check. When true, diagnostics are appended but do not block the write; activation remains definitive. |
| `dataType` | string | No | DOMA/DTEL: ABAP data type (`CHAR`, `NUMC`, `DEC`, ...) |
| `length` | number | No | DOMA/DTEL: data type length |
| `decimals` | number | No | DOMA/DTEL: decimal places |
| `outputLength` | number | No | DOMA: output length |
| `conversionExit` | string | No | DOMA: conversion exit (e.g., `ALPHA`) |
| `signExists` | boolean | No | DOMA: whether signed values are allowed |
| `lowercase` | boolean | No | DOMA: whether lowercase characters are allowed |
| `fixedValues` | array | No | DOMA: fixed value entries (`[{low, high?, description?}]`) |
| `valueTable` | string | No | DOMA: value table reference (e.g., `T001`) |
| `typeKind` | string | No | DTEL: `domain` or `predefinedAbapType` |
| `typeName` | string | No | DTEL: referenced domain/type name (for `typeKind="domain"`) |
| `domainName` | string | No | DTEL alias for `typeName` when referencing a domain. |
| `shortLabel` | string | No | DTEL: short field label |
| `mediumLabel` | string | No | DTEL: medium field label |
| `longLabel` | string | No | DTEL: long field label |
| `headingLabel` | string | No | DTEL: heading field label |
| `searchHelp` | string | No | DTEL: search help name |
| `searchHelpParameter` | string | No | DTEL: search help parameter |
| `setGetParameter` | string | No | DTEL: SET/GET parameter ID |
| `defaultComponentName` | string | No | DTEL: default component name |
| `changeDocument` | boolean | No | DTEL: change document flag |
| `messages` | array | No | MSAG: message entries (`[{number, shortText, longText?}]`) — `number` is a 3-digit string (e.g., `"001"`), `shortText` is the message text (max 73 chars) |
| `serviceDefinition` | string | No | SRVB: referenced service definition name (SRVD). Required for SRVB create. |
| `bindingType` | string | No | SRVB: binding type (default `ODATA`) |
| `odataVersion` | string | No | SRVB OData protocol version, `V2` (default) or `V4`; overrides the value inferred from `bindingType`. |
| `category` | string | No | SRVB: binding category (`0` = UI, `1` = Web API; default `0`) |
| `version` | string | No | SRVB: service version for binding metadata (default `0001`) |
| `refObjectType` | string | No | Required for SKTD/KTD create: parent ADT type/subtype such as `DDLS/DF`, `BDEF/BDO`, `SRVD/SRV`, or `DEVC/K`. |
| `refObjectName` | string | No | SKTD/KTD create: documented parent name; defaults to `name`. |
| `refObjectDescription` | string | No | SKTD/KTD create: parent description shown in ADT tooltips. |
| `shortTexts` | array | No | SKTD/KTD update/create: `[{node, text}]` per-node short texts (max 60 chars; `""` clears). `node` is the full node id or a node name as SAPRead's trailer lists it before ` [` (`GetPhoto`, `finalize`); ambiguous names are refused with the candidates. Root and entity nodes do not take a short text (`obligation="forbidden"`). Works without `source`. |
| `objects` | array | No | For `batch_create`: ordered list of objects (see below) |
| `activateAtEnd` | boolean | No | For `batch_create` only. Default `false` (per-object inline activation). When `true`, ARC-1 writes inactive drafts for every object then issues one terminal batch-activate — SAP's activator resolves cross-references between siblings in a single pass. Use this for interdependent objects (composition-linked DDLS, RAP behavior stacks where parent references not-yet-active child). Partial-failure semantics are unchanged: a write-phase failure still breaks the loop and only the already-written subset is batch-activated. |

**DDIC metadata writes:** `DOMA`, `DTEL`, `MSAG`, and `SRVB` use structured XML payloads and do **not** use `/source/main`. `MSAG` writes use the `/sap/bc/adt/messageclass/` endpoint and accept a `messages` array of `{number, shortText, longText?}` entries. `SRVB` create uses wildcard content type (`application/*`) and SRVB update uses vendor type (`application/vnd.sap.adt.businessservices.servicebinding.v2+xml`).

**Source-based DDIC writes:** `TABL`, `DDLS`, `DCLS`, `BDEF`, `SRVD`, and `SKTD`/`KTD` are source-based and write source via `/source/main`. `TABL` covers both transparent tables (`TABL/DT`) and DDIC structures (`TABL/DS`); ARC-1 auto-resolves between `/ddic/tables/` and `/ddic/structures/` for read/update. `SKTD` writes Markdown knowledge-transfer documentation attached to one KTD-capable ABAP object; `KTD` is accepted as a friendly alias. Create requires `refObjectType` and uses `name` as the documented object name. ARC-1 supports KTD creates for parent types with verified ADT parent URI routing, including `DDLS/DF`, `BDEF/BDO`, `SRVD/SRV`, `SRVB/SVB`, and `DEVC/K`. `CLAS/OC`, `INTF/OI`, and `PROG/P` were not registered for KTD DOCUMENTATION scope on the tested SAP_BASIS 758 and 816 systems; use ABAP Doc for those code objects. Other SAP-registered KTD parent types require ARC-1 parent URI routing before create is enabled. Node bodies are addressed with `## <node id>` sections (a unique node name also works), and per-node short texts with `shortTexts`.

#### Server-driven object writes

`DESD`, `EVTB`, `DTSC`, `CSNM`, `EVTO`, `COTA`, `DSFD`, and `UIAD` are **server-driven objects** (mostly ABAP Platform 2025 / SAP_BASIS 8.16+) — ~46 repository types that share one AFF generic-object contract. `SAPWrite` supports `create`, `update`, and `delete` for them; `SAPActivate` activates them:

- **`create`** posts a minimal `<blue:blueSource>` metadata body to the type's collection (e.g. `/sap/bc/adt/ddic/desd`), then — if `source` is supplied — writes it. The object is left **inactive**; follow with `SAPActivate(type=..., name=...)`.
- **`source` format is per-type.** Most types take **AFF JSON** — e.g. `{"formatVersion":"1","header":{"description":"…","originalLanguage":"en","abapLanguageVersion":"cloudDevelopment"}}` — parse-validated (clean error on malformed JSON) and written to `…/source/main` as `application/json`. `DTSC` and `DSFD` instead take **DDL text** (`define static cache …`, `define scalar function …`), written as `text/plain`; sending the wrong content type is a hard `415` from SAP, so the flavor is pinned per type in `SDO_REGISTRY`. ABAP-specific pre-write steps (lint, RAP preflight, CDS guard) do not apply.
- **`update`** requires `source` (AFF JSON or DDL text, per the type); **`delete`** uses the standard lock → delete flow. Both honor the `allowedPackages` ceiling against the object's real package.
- **Availability is discovery-gated and per-type.** On systems that don't expose a type, write returns a clean `requires SAP_BASIS 8.16+` error. Most types need 8.16+, but `EVTB` (RAP Event Binding), `DSFD` (CDS Scalar Function Definition) and `DTDC` (CDS Dynamic Cache) also ship on S/4HANA 2023 (758) — their write paths are live-verified there (create/update/activate/read/delete). NetWeaver 7.50 exposes none of them.

| Type | Object | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `DESD` | CDS Logical External Schema | Creates standalone — the reference round-trip type. |
| `EVTB` | RAP Event Binding | Also on 758. |
| `EVTO` | RAP Event Object | Create uses the blues **v2** content-type (the others use v1). |
| `DTSC` | CDS Static Cache (table-entity buffer) | Source is **DDL text**, not JSON. |
| `CSNM` | Core Schema Notation Model (CSN) | |
| `COTA` | Communication Target | |
| `DSFD` | CDS Scalar Function Definition | Source is **DDL text**, not JSON. Also on 758. |
| `UIAD` | Launchpad App Descriptor Item (LADI) | Registered, but **writes are refused by SAP outside ABAP Cloud**: `400 Editing of LADIs with ALV "Standard" not allowed in workbench tools` — LADI edits require the ABAP Cloud language version. Read-only in practice on-prem. |
| `DTDC` | CDS Dynamic Cache | **Non-blue** metadata format (`<dtdc:dtdcSource>`). Source is **DDL text** (`define dynamic cache …`). Also on 758. |

Other actions (`edit_method`, surgery, `batch_create`, RAP scaffolding) are not supported for server-driven types and return a clear error.

**Function group (`FUGR`) create:** POSTs `<group:abapFunctionGroup … adtcore:type="FUGR/F">` to `/sap/bc/adt/functions/groups` with content type `application/vnd.sap.adt.functions.groups.v3+xml`. Provide `package` and (for non-`$TMP`) `transport`. Delete the FUGR only after all its function modules have been deleted.

**Function module (`FUNC`) create / update / delete (issue [#250](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/issues/250)):** The parent FUGR must already exist — pass `group` explicitly on create (or auto-resolve via search on update/delete). Create POSTs `<fmodule:abapFunctionModule … adtcore:type="FUGR/FF">` with `<adtcore:containerRef>` to `/sap/bc/adt/functions/groups/{group}/fmodules`. The FM inherits its package from the parent FUGR: omit `package`, or supply the exact inherited package as an assertion. ARC-1 resolves and safety-checks the real FUGR package before creating the contained module, and rejects an explicit mismatch. SAPGUI-style `*"…IMPORTING…"*` parameter comment blocks in source are auto-stripped before PUT as defense-in-depth (SAP rejects them with `FUNC_ADT028`) and a warning is appended in that case.

Execution semantics are function-module metadata, not ABAP source. Set `processingType="rfc"` for a Remote-Enabled module. For update modules, set `processingType="update"` plus an explicit `updateTaskKind`; V1 "Start immediately" is `startImmediate`. ARC-1 rejects processing fields on updates and non-FUNC objects instead of silently ignoring them.

SAP's collection POST creates a normal function-module shell even when it accepts processing attributes. For an explicit processing type, ARC-1 therefore reads the new inactive root, preserves the server-provided representation, applies a locked metadata PUT with the release-negotiated media type, and reads the root back before reporting success. If that post-create step fails, the error warns that a normal shell may remain and must be reviewed or deleted before retrying. When `processingType` is omitted, ARC-1 keeps the pre-existing create behavior without the extra metadata round trips.

#### SAPWrite for FUNC: create / update with structured parameters

Issue [#252](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/issues/252) added structured FM parameter management. Pass a `parameters` array to declare the function module's signature; ARC-1 builds the ABAP-source-based `IMPORTING / EXPORTING / CHANGING / TABLES / EXCEPTIONS / RAISING` clause and splices it into the source body before PUT. SAP ADT exposes parameters ONLY through `/source/main` (verified live on a4h S/4HANA 2023 + NPL 7.50 SP02) — there is no separate metadata endpoint.

Each parameter:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `kind` | string | One of `importing`, `exporting`, `changing`, `tables`, `exceptions`, `raising`. |
| `name` | string | Parameter / exception name. Always uppercased on emit. |
| `type` | string | ABAP type expression (`STRING`, `I`, `BAPIRET2`, `TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF X`, `LIKE DOKHL-OBJECT`, …). Required for IMPORTING/EXPORTING/CHANGING/TABLES; ignored for EXCEPTIONS/RAISING. For TABLES, include the leading `TYPE` or `LIKE` keyword. |
| `byValue` | boolean | Emit `VALUE(name)` wrapper. Default `false` (pass-by-reference). |
| `default` | string | Raw ABAP literal — IMPORTING/CHANGING only. Emitted verbatim (no escaping). Examples: `'X'`, `0`, `space`. |
| `optional` | boolean | Emit `OPTIONAL` keyword. |

Example — create an FM with a typed signature:

```jsonc
SAPWrite({
  action: "create",
  type: "FUNC",
  name: "Z_GREET",
  group: "ZARC1_FG",
  description: "Greet a user",
  parameters: [
    { kind: "importing", name: "IV_NAME",  type: "STRING", byValue: true, default: "'World'" },
    { kind: "exporting", name: "EV_GREET", type: "STRING", byValue: true },
    { kind: "raising",   name: "CX_ROOT" }
  ],
  source: "  ev_greet = |Hello { iv_name }|.\n"
})
```

The `source` value is the FM body only — ARC-1 wraps it in `FUNCTION Z_GREET …. ENDFUNCTION.` and emits the signature clause from `parameters`. Or pass full `FUNCTION/ENDFUNCTION` source and the splicer will replace just the signature region. Or omit `source` entirely to create an empty-body FM with only the signature.

Round-trip: `SAPRead({type: "FUNC", name: "Z_GREET", group: "ZARC1_FG", includeSignature: true})` returns:

```jsonc
{
  "source": "FUNCTION z_greet\n  IMPORTING\n    VALUE(iv_name) TYPE string DEFAULT 'World'\n  EXPORTING\n    VALUE(ev_greet) TYPE string\n  RAISING\n    cx_root.\n  ev_greet = |Hello { iv_name }|.\nENDFUNCTION.",
  "signature": {
    "importing": [ { "kind": "importing", "name": "IV_NAME", "type": "string", "byValue": true, "default": "'World'" } ],
    "exporting": [ { "kind": "exporting", "name": "EV_GREET", "type": "string", "byValue": true } ],
    "changing":  [],
    "tables":    [],
    "exceptions": [],
    "raising":   [ { "kind": "raising", "name": "CX_ROOT" } ]
  }
}
```

Backward-compat: when `parameters` is omitted, the existing source-only PUT path runs unchanged. When `includeSignature` is omitted on read, the response is plain text source.

##### Reading the processing type back

`SAPRead(type="FUNC", …, includeSignature=true)` reports `processingType` and, for update modules,
`updateTaskKind` alongside the parsed signature — so a caller that set one can verify it took effect.
It is a metadata read, so a failure there adds `propertiesError` to the payload rather than breaking
the signature read. See the create-side docs above for how the attributes are written.

##### Function-group structural includes (`type="INCL"` with `group=`)

`SAPWrite(type="INCL", group=<FUGR>)` creates, updates and deletes a function group's structural includes (`LZ<GROUP>TOP` global data, `F01` subroutines, `O01`/`I01` PBO/PAI modules, `T99` unit tests):

```jsonc
SAPWrite({ action: "create", type: "INCL", name: "LZARC1_FGF01", group: "ZARC1_FG",
           description: "Subroutines", package: "$TMP" })
SAPWrite({ action: "update", type: "INCL", name: "LZARC1_FGF01", group: "ZARC1_FG",
           source: "FORM do_work.\nENDFORM.\n" })
```

- The include **name must start with `L<GROUP>`** — SAP derives the include from its group and rejects anything else with an opaque `500 "Attributes for program … have not been saved"`, so ARC-1 refuses it up front.
- **SAP maintains the main program itself**: creating an include appends its `INCLUDE` line, deleting one comments that line out. No main-program edit is needed.
- The include inherits the group's package — SAP ignores `package` here — so `allowedPackages` is checked against the **group's real package**, and a `package` argument that disagrees with it is refused. On update/delete the include itself is the lock and package-resolution target (its `containerRef` carries the group's package).
- Omitting `group=` targets the standalone program-include collection instead, which still works for ordinary include names. An `L`-prefixed name there is refused with a pointer to `group=` — SAP reserves `L*` for function-group includes and answers with a 500, which would otherwise read as a transient error.

Verified on NW 7.50 SP02 and S/4HANA 2023 (758) — the ADT contract is identical on both.

**Robust to GPT/OpenAI optional-field "overpopulation" (issue #360).** GPT/OpenAI tool callers (especially under Structured Outputs / `strict` mode, the default for the Responses API) tend to over-populate optional fields — emitting `null` for every unused optional, blank strings, or stringified booleans like `"false"`. ARC-1 normalizes these before validation: `null` and empty/whitespace strings are treated as omitted (across every tool), and optional booleans accept real JSON booleans **and** `"true"/"false"/"1"/"0"/"yes"/"no"` (so `signExists="false"` is correctly stored as `false`, never inverted). Practical guidance for tool authors: **omit** optional fields you don't need rather than sending `""`/`null`; `include` is **CLAS-only** (for `update`/`edit_method`/`edit_class_definition`) and is ignored for other types/actions; `delete` needs only `type` and `name` (plus optional `transport`).

**Mixed-case object names rejected on create.** SAP TADIR is uppercase on every release; mixed-case names cause silent corruption (e.g., a DDLS named `Zc_MyView` registers as `ZC_MYVIEW` in TADIR but the source body keeps mixed case, confusing every downstream tool). `SAPWrite(action="create"\|"batch_create")` rejects mixed-case names pre-flight with an actionable error. The source code *inside* the object can still use mixed case (e.g., `define view entity Zc_MyView`); only the TADIR object name needs to be uppercase.

**BDEF creation:** Uses SAP's `blue:blueSource` XML format with content-type `application/vnd.sap.adt.blues.v1+xml`. BDEF objects are created with `type="BDEF"` and require a `source` parameter containing the behavior definition.

**Release gates for pre-7.52 systems.** Several ADT resources simply do not exist before SAP_BASIS 7.52. Rather than surfacing a raw `404` (whose generic hint wrongly suggests the object "was not found"), ARC-1 refuses these up front with a release hint once discovery has been probed:

| Operation | Missing resource | Fallback |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| `SAPWrite create type="TABL"/"TABL/DT"` | `/sap/bc/adt/ddic/tables` | SE11. Writing the source through `/ddic/structures/` instead would flip `DD02L-TABCLASS` to `INTTAB` and corrupt the table |
| `SAPWrite create type="DOMA"` | `/sap/bc/adt/ddic/domains` | SE11. Data elements that reference a domain are blocked with it |
| `SAPWrite create type="TTYP"` | `/sap/bc/adt/ddic/tabletypes` | SE11 |
| `SAPManage action="create_package"` | `/sap/bc/adt/packages` | SE80 / SE21 |

Endpoint absence verified on two independent NW 7.50 systems (a dev edition and an ECC EhP8 7.50 SP31 production system); all four are present on S/4HANA 2023 (758) and ABAP Platform 2025 (816). Structures (`TABL/DS`), data elements, function groups, function modules and includes **do** work on 7.50 — note that DDIC structure source there uses `define type <name> { … }`, not `define structure`.

The gates key off ADT discovery, so a session that never probed (for example a one-shot CLI call) is never blocked — it falls through to SAP's own error.

**DDIC save diagnostics:** On `SAPWrite` save failures for DDIC/RAP artifacts (`TABL`, `DDLS`, `DCLS`, `BDEF`, `SRVD`, `SRVB`, `DDLX`, `DOMA`, `DTEL`), ARC-1 enriches errors with structured diagnostics:
- T100 message identifiers/variables (e.g., `SBD_MESSAGES/007`, `V1..V4`)
- Line-aware details when available
- Best-effort inactive syntax-check output for source-based DDIC creates (`TABL`, `DDLS`, `DCLS`, `BDEF`, `SRVD`, `SRVB`, `DDLX`)

This helps pinpoint the exact failing field/annotation instead of retrying blindly.

**CDS dependency-aware CRUD hints (DDLS):**
- `SAPWrite(action="update", type="DDLS", ...)` appends downstream where-used impact buckets and a concrete re-activation order + `SAPActivate(objects=[...])` template.
- `SAPWrite(action="delete", type="DDLS", ...)` enriches dependency-style delete failures (for example DDIC `[?/039]`) with blocking dependents and suggested delete order.
- Delete hints include cycle-break guidance for mutually-dependent projection graphs (strip redirected/composition clauses, activate stripped versions, then delete).
- If delete guidance lists dependents that were just deleted, treat it as possible stale SAP active dependency/index state and retry after a short wait before deeper cleanup.
- If SAP reports a delete dependency error but current where-used results are empty, ARC-1 now adds stale active-dependency guidance: wait/retry after recent cleanup, activate restored/stripped sources first, then re-check references/locks.
- ARC-1 combines unfiltered ADT where-used results with scoped object-type filters where available. This avoids under-reporting dependents on SAP systems that return only a shallow default usageReferences result.
- If the where-used endpoint is unavailable on the backend, ARC-1 keeps the CRUD action behavior unchanged and adds a short "impact unavailable" note instead of failing the call.

**Blue framework package handling:** `TABL` and `BDEF` create calls now pass package in both the XML (`packageRef`) and URL query (`_package=<pkg>`), alongside transport (`corrNr`) when provided.

**CDS pre-write validation:**

- **Table entity version guard:** `define table entity` syntax requires ABAP Cloud (BTP) or S/4HANA on-premise with SAP_BASIS >= 757. On older systems, ARC-1 rejects the write early with an actionable message instead of letting SAP fail with a generic error.
- **Reserved keyword warnings:** CDS field names like `position`, `value`, `type`, `data` etc. may be CDS reserved keywords that cause silent DDL save failures. ARC-1 detects these and includes an advisory warning (non-blocking) suggesting renamed alternatives.
- **Empty DDLS source:** When reading a DDLS that exists but has no stored source, ARC-1 returns an explicit warning instead of silent empty content.

**ARC-1-native pre-write semantic hints (TABL):**

ARC-1 layers a small set of release-aware, RAP-convention hints on top of the abaplint pass. They emit `severity:'warning'` only — the write is not blocked. The first hint surfaces a known draft-table anti-pattern; future hints follow the same pattern in `src/lint/pre-write-hints.ts`.

- **`arc1-tabl-draft-admin-include`:** A TABL source contains `include sych_bdl_draft_admin_inc` without the SAP-canonical named-include prefix `"%admin" : include sych_bdl_draft_admin_inc;`. The bare include activates at TABL level on most releases but is non-canonical per ABAP keyword doc [ABENBDL_DRAFT_TABLE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/ABENBDL_DRAFT_TABLE.html) and breaks BDEF binding for some draft scenarios. SAP standard draft tables (e.g. `BOTD_TAB_ROOT_D`) all use the named form. Hint surfaces in the response `warnings` array with `rule: 'arc1-tabl-draft-admin-include'`.

**RAP deterministic preflight validation:**

- Runs before `create`/`update`/`batch_create` for RAP-prone source types (`TABL`, `BDEF`, `DDLX`, `DDLS`).
- Blocks writes on deterministic rule errors (for example: missing `@Semantics.amount.currencyCode` for `abap.curr`, invalid `authorization master ( none )`, unsupported DDLX scope annotations on on-prem 7.5x).
- Emits warning-only findings for non-fatal patterns (for example: explicit client in DDLS select list).
- Per-call override: `preflightBeforeWrite=false`.

**Batch creation:**

`batch_create` creates and activates multiple objects in sequence via a single tool call. Objects are processed in array order — put dependencies first (e.g., domain before data element, TABL before DDLS, DCLS after DDLS, BDEF after CDS views). Each object in the array has: `type` (string, required), `name` (string, required), `source` (string, optional), `description` (string, optional), optional `package` and `transport` overrides, plus optional DOMA/DTEL metadata fields. A `FUNC` entry also accepts `group`, `processingType`, `updateTaskKind`, and structured `parameters`; `group` may instead be supplied once at the top level when all FUNC entries share it. Item-level `package` and `transport` override the top-level values for ordinary objects. A contained `FUNC` always inherits its FUGR package, so omit its package or use the exact inherited value as an assertion.

If any object fails, processing stops and the response reports which objects succeeded and which failed. AFF metadata validation runs automatically for supported types (CLAS, INTF, PROG, DDLS, BDEF, SRVD, SRVB) — invalid metadata is rejected before hitting SAP.

**Deferred activation for interdependent objects (`activateAtEnd: true`):** By default, each object is created → source written → activated, in order. This works for linear dependency chains but fails when siblings cross-reference each other (e.g. composition-linked DDLS where the parent's `composition [0..*] of ZR_CHILD` references a not-yet-active child, or a RAP behavior stack where the BDEF refers to a draft SRVD). Set `activateAtEnd: true` to defer activation: ARC-1 writes inactive drafts for every object then issues one terminal `activateBatch` call. SAP's activator sees the whole graph at once and resolves cross-references internally. Partial-failure semantics are unchanged — a write-phase failure still breaks the loop, and the terminal batch-activate runs only over the already-written subset.

**RAP handler scaffolding:**

`scaffold_rap_handlers` derives required behavior-pool `METHODS ... FOR ...` signatures from an interface BDEF, computes missing signatures, and can optionally create missing local handler skeletons plus inject declarations and empty `METHOD ... ENDMETHOD` stubs into the behavior pool class:

- Scans class sections from `source/main`, `includes/definitions`, and `includes/implementations`
- In `autoApply=true`, creates missing `CLASS lhc_<alias> DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cl_abap_behavior_handler` shells in `includes/definitions` and matching implementation shells in `includes/implementations`
- Supports dry-run listing (`autoApply=false`, default) and write-back mode (`autoApply=true`)
- Helps recover from generic behavior-pool save errors by generating exact signatures for actions/determinations/validations/authorization handlers

```

`generate_behavior_implementation` is the reliable equivalent of Eclipse ADT's "Generate Behavior Implementation" Cmd+1 quickfix. Auto-discovers the BDEF via the class metadata's `<class:rootEntityRef>` element, cross-validates that MAIN's `FOR BEHAVIOR OF <bdef>` and the BDEF's `managed implementation in class <class>` agree, scaffolds every required handler (creating missing `lhc_<alias>` skeletons), writes CCDEF + CCIMP under one stateful lock, and (by default) activates the class. Avoids the broken `/sap/bc/adt/quickfixes/proposals/.../create_class_implementation` server endpoint (HTTP 500 on a4h regardless of payload, verified live during PR-C research 2026-05-10).


**Transport behavior:**

- **`update` and `delete`**: ARC-1 automatically reuses the correction number from the SAP object lock when no explicit `transport` is provided. This means writes to transportable objects often succeed without manually specifying a transport.
- **`create` and `batch_create`**: ARC-1 performs a **transport pre-flight check** for non-`$TMP` packages when no transport is provided. This calls the SAP transport checks endpoint to determine whether a transport number is required:
  - If the object is already locked in a transport, ARC-1 auto-uses that transport.
  - If the package is local (e.g., `$TMP`), no transport is needed — creation proceeds.
  - If a transport IS required but none was provided, ARC-1 returns an actionable error message listing existing transports and guiding the caller to use `SAPTransport(action="list")` or `SAPTransport(action="create")` first.
  - If the pre-flight check fails (older system, permissions), ARC-1 proceeds and lets SAP handle the error.

**Note:** Not available by default (read-only mode). Enable with `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true` / `--allow-writes=true`. Write access is restricted to package `$TMP` by default; to write to other packages, set `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES='$TMP,Z*'` (quote in shell so `$TMP` isn't expanded).

### Procedural unit surgery

[Issue #558](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/issues/558). On-prem `action="edit_unit"` replaces one named `FORM…ENDFORM` or `MODULE…ENDMODULE` block in a `PROG` or `INCL` without making the caller re-send the full program. ARC-1 reads the latest active or inactive-draft source directly from SAP, finds the block with abaplint's structure tree, validates that the replacement has the same kind and name, splices it, then uses the normal package gate and lock/modify/unlock write path.

Pass the complete replacement block so multi-line FORM signatures and MODULE direction (`INPUT`/`OUTPUT`) remain explicit. The action is case-insensitive by unit name, preserves CRLF source files, leaves sibling units untouched, and does not auto-activate. Run `SAPActivate` afterwards. Function-group structural includes are supported with `type="INCL", group="<FUGR>"`; activate those with the same `type`, `name`, and `group` so ARC-1 addresses the structural include directly on every supported release.

```jsonc
{
  "action": "edit_unit",
  "type": "PROG",
  "name": "ZPROG_ORDERS",
  "unit": "PROCESS_ORDERS",
  "source": "FORM process_orders USING iv_force TYPE abap_bool.\n  \" new implementation\nENDFORM.",
  "transport": "DEVK900001"
}
```

Event blocks such as `START-OF-SELECTION` and `AT SELECTION-SCREEN` are intentionally unsupported: abaplint does not expose them as bounded structure nodes, so name-based replacement cannot provide the same safety guarantee. `FUNC` is also out of scope because each function module already has a dedicated `/source/main` resource containing only that function module.

### Class-section surgery

[Issue #303](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/issues/303). Four token-efficient `SAPWrite` actions for editing a global ABAP class without re-sending the full `/source/main` body. All require `type=CLAS` and use SAP's existing `/sap/bc/adt/oo/classes/{name}/objectstructure` endpoint to locate the precise line ranges to splice — no client-side ABAP parsing of the existing source is needed.

Backing pattern for main-source surgery: GET `/objectstructure` → fetch active or inactive-draft `/source/main` → splice → PUT under lock → no auto-activate. Caller runs `SAPActivate` next. For `edit_class_definition include=...`, ARC-1 whole-replaces the class-local include directly and auto-initializes a missing include under the same parent class lock before the PUT.

#### `action="edit_class_definition"` — replace the DEFINITION block whole

Without `include=`, send only the new global `CLASS … DEFINITION … ENDCLASS.` block (typical ~10–80 lines for a 20-method class). ARC-1 fetches the existing `/source/main`, splices the new DEFINITION over the existing one, and PUTs back. The IMPLEMENTATION block is preserved verbatim.

With `include=definitions|implementations|macros|testclasses`, send the full replacement body for that local include. For ABAP Unit tests, target `include="testclasses"` and write local `ltc_*` classes; ARC-1 creates the missing CCAU include automatically on first write.

**Refuse-policy.** Before PUT, ARC-1 diffs the new DEFINITION against the current class structure. If the diff would produce a non-activatable draft, the call is refused with a structured error pointing at the right tool:

- Added concrete method without a matching `METHOD …. ENDMETHOD.` block in IMPLEMENTATION → "use `add_method`".
- Removed method that still has an orphan METHOD/ENDMETHOD block in IMPLEMENTATION → "use `delete_method`".

Exempted from the symmetry check (no IMPL needed): `ABSTRACT METHODS`, `EVENTS`, `INTERFACES`, `ALIASES`. For `include=` writes (CCDEF), the refuse-policy is skipped — cross-include validation is not performed; rely on `SAPActivate` to catch breaks.

```jsonc
// Drop FINAL from a class without touching any method
{
  "action": "edit_class_definition",
  "type": "CLAS",
  "name": "ZCL_ORDER",
  "source": "CLASS zcl_order DEFINITION PUBLIC CREATE PUBLIC.\n  PUBLIC SECTION.\n    METHODS process RETURNING VALUE(r) TYPE abap_bool.\n  PRIVATE SECTION.\n    DATA mv_id TYPE string.\nENDCLASS."
}
```

#### `action="add_method"` — atomic DEFINITION + IMPLEMENTATION insert

Insert a METHODS clause AND an empty `METHOD <name>. ENDMETHOD.` stub in one PUT. Default target is `visibility=public`. The target section header must already exist; if missing, ARC-1 refuses with a hint to use `edit_class_definition` to add the section first.

```jsonc
{
  "action": "add_method",
  "type": "CLAS",
  "name": "ZCL_ORDER",
  "method": "METHODS greet IMPORTING who TYPE string RETURNING VALUE(r) TYPE string.",
  "visibility": "public"
}
// → inserts METHODS greet ... in PUBLIC SECTION + empty METHOD greet. ENDMETHOD. in IMPLEMENTATION
```

Pass `abstract: true` to skip the IMPLEMENTATION stub (for `METHODS x ABSTRACT.` in an abstract class).

#### `action="edit_method_signature"` — replace one METHODS clause

One range replacement on a method's declaration. The IMPLEMENTATION block is untouched — any body incompatibility surfaces at `SAPActivate`, same as today's `edit_method` contract.

```jsonc
{
  "action": "edit_method_signature",
  "type": "CLAS",
  "name": "ZCL_ORDER",
  "method": "process",
  "source": "    METHODS process IMPORTING force TYPE abap_bool DEFAULT abap_false RETURNING VALUE(r) TYPE abap_bool."
}
```

#### `action="delete_method"` — atomic DEFINITION + IMPLEMENTATION remove

Drops both the METHODS clause and the METHOD…ENDMETHOD body in one PUT. ABSTRACT methods (no IMPL) have only the DEFINITION line removed.

> ⚠️ **Destructive — discards the method body.** Do **not** use `delete_method` + `add_method` to change a method's visibility: that recreates an empty stub and loses the implementation. Use [`change_method_visibility`](#actionchange_method_visibility-move-a-method-between-sections-body-preserved) instead, which moves the declaration while leaving the body untouched.

```jsonc
{
  "action": "delete_method",
  "type": "CLAS",
  "name": "ZCL_ORDER",
  "method": "deprecated_helper"
}
```

#### `action="change_method_visibility"` — move a method between sections (body preserved)

Moves a method's METHODS clause from its current visibility section to a target section (`public` / `protected` / `private`). Touches the **DEFINITION only** — the IMPLEMENTATION block (the method body) is preserved verbatim. This is the safe, token-efficient way to change visibility: send the method name + target section instead of re-sending the whole DEFINITION (`edit_class_definition`), and without the data loss of `delete_method` + `add_method`.

- Idempotent: if the method is already in the target section, it's a no-op (no write).
- The target section header must already exist; if not, ARC-1 refuses with a hint to add it via `edit_class_definition` first.

```jsonc
{
  "action": "change_method_visibility",
  "type": "CLAS",
  "name": "ZCL_ORDER",
  "method": "process",
  "visibility": "private"
}
// → METHODS process … clause moves from its current section to PRIVATE SECTION;
//   METHOD process. … ENDMETHOD. body in IMPLEMENTATION is untouched.
```

#### Cross-release notes

Verified live on a4h (S/4HANA 2023, kernel 7.58) end-to-end. The underlying `/objectstructure` endpoint also works on NW 7.50 SP02 (reads verified); on that release methods are split across `CLAS/OO` (def) + `CLAS/OM` (impl) elements and merged by name in the parser. Writes on the un-patched NW 7.50 dev edition can trip [SAP Note 2727890](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2727890) "ADT: fix unstable adt lock handle" — a system-level bug affecting every ADT write, not specific to this feature; ARC-1 detects the 423 status and emits a hint.

### Class text symbols

Read and write a global class's **text symbols** (`Textsymbole` / class text elements — `'Text'(001)` literals) via the ADT textelements service.

```
SAPRead(type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER", include="text_symbols")   — read the maintained text pool
SAPWrite(action="edit_text_symbols", type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER",
         source="@MaxLength:20\n001=Order\n\n@MaxLength:30\n002=Order created\n")
```

- **Body format:** one `@MaxLength:NN` line per symbol, then `NNN=text`; symbols are blank-line separated. A shared/missing `@MaxLength` is rejected (`406 "Text elements contain errors"`).
- **Immediately active** — no `SAPActivate` needed. Defining the referenced symbols is what clears the ATC finding *"Text symbol NNN not defined"* that a bare `'Text'(001)` literal otherwise leaves behind.
- **On-prem only, discovery-gated.** The service is present on SAP_BASIS ≥ 7.51 (verified on 758 + 816) and absent on NW 7.50 — ARC-1 returns a clean "textelements service not available" error there.
- **Scope:** text symbols only. Selection texts are a program selection-screen concept — a class has none, so `source/selections` is always empty and un-writable (SAP `406`); program/function-group text elements are a planned follow-up.

Verified live end-to-end on a4h (758): create a `$TMP` class referencing `'Hi'(001)` → `edit_text_symbols` → read back → `SAPActivate` clean.

## SAPActivate

Activate (publish) ABAP objects. Supports single object or batch activation.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | No | `activate` (default), `publish_srvb`, or `unpublish_srvb`. Publish/unpublish makes an SRVB OData binding available/unavailable. |
| `name` | string | No | Object name (for single activation) |
| `type` | string | No | Object type (`PROG`, `CLAS`, `DDLS`, `DDLX`, `BDEF`, `SRVD`, `SRVB`, etc.) |
| `group` | string | No | Parent function group for `FUNC` or a function-group structural `INCL`. May also be set per batch item. |
| `version` | string | No | Service version for SRVB publish/unpublish (default `0001`). |
| `service_type` | string | No | `odatav2` or `odatav4` for SRVB publish/unpublish routing; auto-detected from binding metadata when omitted. |
| `preaudit` | boolean | No | Request pre-activation audit from SAP (default: `true`). Set `false` to skip pre-audit for faster activation. |
| `objects` | array | No | For batch: array of `{type, name, group?}` objects to activate together |

Use batch activation for RAP stacks where objects depend on each other (DDLS, BDEF, SRVD, DDLX, SRVB must be activated together). Batch responses include per-object status (`active`, `warning`, `error`) with attached messages, so failed members can be retried selectively.

For failed `DDLS` activation, ARC-1 appends CDS dependency impact buckets and a concrete batch re-activation template derived from where-used results.

**Examples:**
```
SAPActivate(type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER")
SAPActivate(type="INCL", name="LZFGTOP", group="ZFG")
SAPActivate(objects=[{type:"DDLS",name:"ZI_TRAVEL"},{type:"BDEF",name:"ZI_TRAVEL"},{type:"SRVD",name:"ZSD_TRAVEL"}])
SAPActivate(action="publish_srvb", type="SRVB", name="ZUI_TRAVEL_O4", service_type="odatav4")
```

**Note:** Not available by default (read-only mode). Enable with `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true` / `--allow-writes=true`.

---

## SAPNavigate

Navigate code: find definitions, references (where-used), code completion, and class hierarchy.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | Yes | `definition`, `references`, `completion`, or `hierarchy` |
| `uri` | string | No | Source URI of the object. Optional for `references` if `type`+`name` are provided. |
| `type` | string | No | Object type (PROG, CLAS, INTF, FUNC, etc.) — alternative to `uri` for `references`. |
| `name` | string | No | Object name — alternative to `uri` for `references`. |
| `objectType` | string | No | For `references`: keep only results of this ADT type, slash format (`CLAS/OC`, `PROG/P`, `FUGR/FF`). A bare prefix (`CLAS`) matches every subtype. Applied client-side. |
| `maxResults` | number | No | For `references`: max entries (default 100, max 1000). `total` counts every match of the filter. |
| `line` | number | No | Line number (1-based) |
| `column` | number | No | Column number (1-based) |
| `source` | string | No | Current source code |

**References action (Where-Used):** Uses the full scope-based Where-Used API, returning detailed results with package info. Falls back to the simpler reference lookup on older SAP systems that don't support the scope endpoint.

Returns a paged envelope — `{total, shown, truncated, hint?, references}` — because where-used is
unbounded: `CL_ABAP_TYPEDESCR` has 6,644 references (~968K tokens, several times a context window).
**`total` is the number of matches, not the page length**, so a capped page still reports the real
blast radius.

Paging and `objectType` filtering are both client-side, and deliberately so: SAP's
`usageReferences` endpoint declares only `{?uri}` and ignores every limit or filter we can send
(verified live across nine request variants, all byte-identical). The full set therefore still
crosses the wire — this bounds what reaches the model, not what SAP computes.

**Hierarchy action:** Returns the class inheritance chain via `SEOMETAREL`: superclass (or null), implemented interfaces, and direct subclasses. Requires `name` parameter (class name). It needs either table preview (`SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=true` + `data` scope) or freestyle SQL (`SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true` + `sql` scope). ARC-1 uses SQL when available and falls back to named table preview.

**Examples:**
```
SAPNavigate(action="definition", uri="/sap/bc/adt/programs/programs/ztest", line=10, column=5)
SAPNavigate(action="references", uri="/sap/bc/adt/oo/classes/zcl_order")
SAPNavigate(action="references", type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER")
SAPNavigate(action="references", type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER", objectType="PROG/P")
SAPNavigate(action="completion", uri="/sap/bc/adt/programs/programs/ztest", line=10, column=15, source="...")
SAPNavigate(action="hierarchy", name="ZCL_ORDER")
```

---

## SAPQuery

Execute ABAP SQL queries against SAP tables.

> **Self-correcting errors.** An unknown *table* yields a "Did you mean …?" suggestion; an unknown *column* (here or in `SAPRead type=TABLE_QUERY`) yields the table's actual column list (`Unknown column "X" on T000. Available columns: MANDT, MTEXT, …`), so the agent retries in one shot. Best-effort: if column discovery is unavailable (e.g. the `datapreview` endpoint is unbound on older NW 7.50 SPs), the original error is returned unchanged.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `sql` | string | Yes | ABAP SQL SELECT statement |
| `maxRows` | number | No | Maximum rows (default 100) |

**Important:** Uses the ADT freestyle SQL endpoint (`/sap/bc/adt/datapreview/freestyle`) with ABAP SQL syntax, NOT standard SQL:
- Use `alias~field` for qualified fields (not `alias.field`; a dot ends the ABAP statement)
- Use `ASCENDING`/`DESCENDING` (not `ASC`/`DESC`)
- Use `maxRows` parameter (not `LIMIT`)
- `GROUP BY`, `COUNT(*)`, `WHERE` all work
- ABAP SQL aggregate rule applies: non-aggregated selected fields must be listed in `GROUP BY`

JOINs, aggregates, and subqueries are supported. For a plain projection `SELECT`, ARC-1 automatically chunks the longest literal `IN (...)` list—even when the query has several `IN` clauses—and merges the rows. Queries with `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `DISTINCT`, `UNION`, or aggregates are sent whole because concatenating per-chunk results would change their semantics. If a backend rejects a long list in one of those queries, split the list manually, union the results, and re-sort client-side when needed.

See: [SAPQuery Freestyle Capability Matrix](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-04-21-sapquery-freestyle-capability-matrix.md)

**Examples:**
```
SAPQuery(sql="SELECT carrid, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM sflight GROUP BY carrid ORDER BY cnt DESCENDING")
SAPQuery(sql="SELECT * FROM mara WHERE matnr LIKE 'Z%'", maxRows=50)
```

**Note:** Not available by default (free SQL blocked). Enable with `SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true` / `--allow-free-sql=true`. User also needs the `sql` scope (or API-key profile `viewer-sql`/`developer-sql`/`admin`).

---

## SAPTransport

Manage CTS transport requests (SE09/SE10 equivalent): list, get details, **diff (review what a transport changed)**, create, release, delete, reassign owner, recursive release, check transport requirements, and inspect an object's current lock/assignment status. The legacy action name for that status lookup is `history`, but it is not complete transport history. `create` uses the ADT `CreateCorrectionRequest` endpoint, which works on both NetWeaver 7.50+ and S/4HANA.

In multi-target v1, only the read-only `list`, `get`, `check`, and `history` actions are listed and
accepted. Transport mutations and topology actions remain structurally unavailable; `diff` is also
excluded there because it fans out many source reads per call.

### `action="diff"` — reviewing what a transport changed

Returns, per object, a unified diff between the revision written under the transport and the one
immediately before it. LIMU entries (methods, class includes) are rolled up to their owning class,
and a class is diffed across the includes the transport actually touched.

Every part carries the evidence behind its diff — read `baselineStatus` before summarising:

| `baselineStatus` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prior-revision` | The diff is what this transport changed. |
| `prior-revision-unverified` | A predecessor exists, but the "after" side was only guessed — it may belong to another change. |
| `no-prior-snapshot` | Created in this transport. |
| `baseline-ambiguous` | No usable baseline. An all-additions block is **not** proof of creation. |
| `baseline-unavailable` | The read failed. Never report this as unchanged. |

Objects with no source revision feed (domains, data elements, function-group sources, …) are returned
with an `inventoryReason` instead of parts: they are in scope, just not diffable. Long diffs are
truncated per part with `diffTruncated: true`; `added`/`removed` still reflect the full change.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | Yes | `list`, `get`, `diff`, `create`, `release`, `delete`, `remove_object`, `reassign`, `release_recursive`, `check`, `history`, `layers`, or `targets` (the last two are advertised only when transport support is enabled) |
| `id` | string | No | Transport request ID, e.g. `A4HK900123` (for get/diff/release/delete/remove_object/reassign/release_recursive) |
| `offset` | number | No | For `diff`: index of the first object to diff (default 0). Page with `limit`. |
| `limit` | number | No | For `diff`: objects per call (default 20, max 40 — the same ceiling SAP's own transport-diff tool uses). |
| `description` | string | No | Transport description text (required for create) |
| `name` | string | No | Object name (for check/history/remove_object actions, e.g. `ZCL_ORDER`) |
| `package` | string | No | Package name. For `create`: optional — defaults to `$TMP`; an explicit package influences the route/target while the request remains Workbench type K. For `check`: required. |
| `target` | string | No | Explicit create target (`C11`, `C11.021`, or `/TRG/`). SAP validates it; system.client/group forms require extended transport control, and 7.50 does not support the target-setting ADT action. Discover valid values with `action="targets"`; never invent one. |
| `transportLayer` | string | No | Advanced create override for SAP's consolidation-route resolution. Omit normally so the package chooses the route; discover valid values with `action="layers"`. |
| `user` | string | No | SAP username to filter by (for list). Defaults to the current SAP user. Use `*` to list all users. |
| `status` | string | No | Transport status filter (for list). `D`=modifiable (default), `L`=modifiable/protected, `O`=release started, `P`=release preparation, `R`=released, `N`=released with import protection, `*`=all statuses. |
| `type` | string | No | Object type for `check`/`history`/`remove_object` actions (`PROG`, `CLAS`, `DDLS`, etc.). For `remove_object` it is the CTS/E071 object type exactly as shown by `get` (e.g. `PROG`, `DEVC`). Not used by `create`, which creates a Workbench (K) request. |
| `operation` | string | No | For `check`: `create` (default, sends ADT operation `I`) or `modify` (sends the empty modify operation). |
| `pgmid` | string | No | Program ID for `remove_object`: `R3TR` (whole object) or `LIMU` (sub-object). Required for `remove_object` — the object type alone does not determine `pgmid`. |
| `owner` | string | No | New owner SAP username (required for reassign) |
| `recursive` | boolean | No | Apply recursively to child tasks (for delete/reassign). `release_recursive` always recurses. |
| `removeLockedObjects` | boolean | No | For delete: remove locked object entries from each task before deleting when SAP would otherwise reject the request as containing locked objects. This mutates request contents. |
| `summary` | boolean | No | For `list` only. **Default `true`** — headers-only: omits each transport's (and task's) `objects[]`, keeping `id`/`description`/`owner`/`status`/`target` plus an `objectCount`. Pass `false` for full object lists (~5x larger). |
| `maxResults` | number | No | Maximum list rows or check/history assignment candidates (defaults: list/history 50, check 10; max 1000). |
| `resultFormat` | string | No | For `release`/`release_recursive`: `legacy` text (default) or `structured` JSON with outcome, per-ID confirmation evidence, polls, elapsed time, and SAP reports. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | number | No | For `release`/`release_recursive`: terminal-state verification budget; default `300`, range `1..1800`. |

**Actions:**

- **`list`** — List transport requests. Defaults to current user, modifiable (status D), all types (Workbench, Customizing, Transport of Copies). Returns a paged envelope `{total, shown, truncated, transports}` — `total` is the full backlog, so a capped page still reports it. Summarised by default (object lists dropped, `objectCount` kept): scan cheaply, then `get` the one you want in full; pass `summary=false` for the object lists. Paged at `maxResults` (default 50, max 1000). Live: 55 requests went 104 KB / ~26K tokens → 23 KB / ~5.7K tokens.
- **`get`** — Get transport details including tasks and objects.
- **`create`** — Create a new Workbench (K) transport request. Requires `description`. Optional `package` (defaults to `$TMP` — pass an explicit package to influence the transport route/target, not the request category). Uses the ADT `CreateCorrectionRequest` endpoint (`POST /sap/bc/adt/cts/transports`); legacy NW 7.50 systems are supported.
- **`release`** — Release a single request or task, then verify terminal CTS evidence. Requests are read back in `R` or `N`; released tasks may disappear from SAP's organizer tree and are then confirmed only after an accepted release report. Timeout, unknown state, or unexplained disappearance is an error. Use `resultFormat="structured"` for convergence evidence.
- **`delete`** — Delete a transport. Use `recursive=true` to delete tasks first. `removeLockedObjects=true` first strips locked entries from each task when necessary; it is not a dry-run option.
- **`remove_object`** — Remove a single object from a request while **keeping the request** (the SE09/SE10 "remove from request" operation). Requires the full CTS object key `pgmid` + `type` + `name` (the object type alone does not determine `pgmid` — e.g. `COMM` is valid under both `R3OB` and `LIMU`). ARC-1 resolves the entry from the request's object list and removes it via the ADT `removeobject` operation; the object itself is **not** deleted. Functional on SAP_BASIS 7.58/8.16; on NW 7.5x the backend ignores `removeobject` (HTTP 400) — clean such requests in SE09/SE10.
- **`reassign`** — Change transport owner. Requires `owner`. Use `recursive=true` for tasks too.
- **`release_recursive`** — Freeze the original parent/task tree, release its unreleased tasks first and then the parent, and verify every frozen ID. Requests must be read back in terminal `R` or `N`; released tasks that SAP folds out of the tree are confirmed by an accepted task release or the terminal parent. An unexplained disappearance, timeout, or unknown state is an error. This action is refused under restrictive exact/prefix `SAP_ALLOWED_TRANSPORTS`; only the legacy empty allowlist or explicit `*` can authorize a live subtree that may gain a concurrent child. Use either only when every current/concurrent child is intended to be released.
- **`check`** — Check whether a transport is required for creating or modifying an object in a specific package. Requires `type`, `name`, and `package`; `operation` defaults to `create`. Returns whether a transport is required, whether a new assignment is required, local-package status, bounded candidate requests, SAP diagnostics, and any existing lock with owner/task details. **Does NOT require `--allow-transport-writes`** — this is a read-only pre-flight check.
- **`history`** — Legacy action name for current object transport status. Given `type` + `name`, it returns at most the request currently holding the object lock in `relatedTransports`, plus bounded `candidateTransports` the object could be assigned to. Candidates do **not** contain the object and are not historical/conflict evidence. Complete history requires an authorized E071/E070 data workflow because the standard ADT endpoints expose only current assignment state. Read-only; does NOT require `--allow-transport-writes`.
- **`layers`** — List the transport layers and their resolved targets where available. Read-only value help for `create.transportLayer`; release-dependent.
- **`targets`** — List valid transport targets (Transportziel / TR_TARGET). Read-only value help for `create.target`; release-dependent.

**Check action output:**
```json
{
  "operation": "create",
  "package": "ZDEV",
  "transportRequired": true,
  "transportAssignmentRequired": true,
  "isLocal": false,
  "deliveryUnit": "HOME",
  "result": "S",
  "existingTransportTotal": 1,
  "existingTransportsShown": 1,
  "existingTransports": [
    { "id": "A4HK900123", "description": "My transport", "owner": "DEVELOPER" }
  ],
  "existingTransportsTruncated": false,
  "summary": "Package \"ZDEV\" requires a transport assignment for object creation."
}
```

**Current object transport status output (`history` legacy action name):**
```json
{
  "object": { "type": "CLAS", "name": "ZCL_ORDER", "uri": "/sap/bc/adt/oo/classes/zcl_order" },
  "relatedTransports": [],
  "candidateTransports": [
    { "id": "A4HK900124", "description": "Refactor", "owner": "DEVELOPER" }
  ],
  "candidateTotal": 1,
  "candidateTruncated": false,
  "summary": "Object ZCL_ORDER has no active lock; 1 transport(s) available for assignment."
}
```

When an object is currently locked, `lockedTransport` is present, `relatedTransports` contains that
one parent request, and `candidateTransports` is empty.

**List defaults:** Without parameters, `list` returns modifiable transports (status D) for the current SAP user, across all transport types (Workbench, Customizing, Transport of Copies). Query params follow sapcli's `workbench_params()` pattern (`requestType=KWT`, `requestStatus`).

**Protocol compatibility:** ARC-1 uses startup ADT service discovery (`/sap/bc/adt/discovery`) to proactively select endpoint MIME types, with endpoint-specific CTS media types and a one-retry 406/415 fallback as defense-in-depth.

**Note:** Transport mutations (`create`, `release`, `release_recursive`, `reassign`, `delete`, `remove_object`) require `write` + `transports` scopes and both `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true` and `SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORT_WRITES=true`. `list`, `get`, `diff`, `check`, `history`, `layers`, and `targets` are read actions and work without `--allow-transport-writes`.

## SAPGit

Git-based ABAP repository workflows with backend auto-selection: **gCTS** is preferred when available,
otherwise ARC-1 uses the **abapGit ADT bridge**. gCTS is currently read-only in ARC-1; its mutation
actions fail closed before any mutating HTTP request.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | Yes | `list_repos`, `whoami`, `config`, `branches`, `external_info`, `history`, `objects`, `check`, `stage`, `clone`, `pull`, `push`, `switch_branch`, `create_branch`, `unlink` |
| `backend` | string | No | Optional backend override: `gcts` or `abapgit` |
| `repoId` | string | No | Repository ID/key (required by most repo-scoped actions) |
| `url` | string | No | Remote Git URL (required for `clone`, and for abapGit `external_info`) |
| `branch` | string | No | Branch name (for switch/create branch) |
| `package` | string | No | ABAP package (required for clone/create on package-bound backends) |
| `transport` | string | No | Transport request (backend-dependent) |
| `commit` | string | No | Commit SHA (for gCTS `pull` by commit) |
| `message` | string | Yes for `push` | Commit message for abapGit `push` |
| `objects` | array | No | For abapGit `push`, the changed objects to commit (`[{type,name}]`); omit to push every local change |
| `user` | string | No | Remote Git username |
| `password` | string | No | Remote Git password |
| `token` | string | No | abapGit remote token, sent as basic auth with user `x-access-token` (GitHub convention) unless `user` is also given. gCTS mutations, including credential-bearing repository creation, are quarantined. |
| `limit` | number | No | Limit for history queries (gCTS) |

**Backend support matrix:**

- **Both backends:** `list_repos`
- **gCTS reads:** `whoami`, `config`, `branches`, `history`, `objects`
- **abapGit only:** `external_info`, `check`, `stage`, `clone`, `pull`, `push`, `switch_branch`,
  `create_branch`, `unlink`
- **gCTS mutation names, currently quarantined:** `clone`, `pull`, `switch_branch`,
  `create_branch`, `unlink`

**Safety and scope rules:**

- Repository/configuration reads require `read` scope (HTTP auth mode).
- abapGit mutations (`clone`, `pull`, `push`, `stage`, `switch_branch`, `create_branch`, `unlink`)
  require `git` scope, `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true`, and `SAP_ALLOW_GIT_WRITES=true`.
- `external_info` also requires those mutation gates. Although it returns metadata, SAP performs
  outbound network access to a caller-selected remote URL. All remote URLs must be absolute HTTPS
  without userinfo; `external_info` additionally rejects localhost and literal private/link-local
  addresses. DNS-aware resolution/hostname allowlisting remains a follow-up.
- Package-bound clone and repository actions that import, export, change branch, or unlink enforce the
  configured allowlist against the real server-side package. A caller-supplied package cannot widen
  that boundary. The allowlist must contain the exact repository subtree pattern (`<ROOT>/**`) or
  `*`; an exact root entry or a broad prefix such as `Z*` is not sufficient for these subtree-wide
  operations.
- Every gCTS mutation is additionally quarantined and returns an error before HTTP mutation, even when
  the write gates are enabled. Safe support is deferred until ARC-1 can stage without import, inventory
  affected objects, preflight authorization, deploy explicitly, confirm terminal state, and roll back.

**abapGit private repositories:** pass `user` + `password`, or just `token`. ARC-1 forwards them to the
bridge on every remote-touching call — `external_info`, `clone`, `pull`, `check`, `stage`, `push`,
`switch_branch`, `create_branch` — as the `Username` / base64 `Password` headers the abapGit ADT backend
reads. They are request-scoped: never stored, never logged (the `Password` header is redacted). In CLI
automation, load them from a protected JSON input or secret-backed workflow rather than literal argv.

**Mutation evidence and retry contract:**

- abapGit `clone`/`pull` responses report bridge object rows and repository readback, not complete
  import/activation reconciliation. Non-empty rows are returned with `verified:false`; an empty wrapper
  is an incomplete/error result, never proof that an import succeeded.
- `push` with no selected local changes is a verified no-op. After a selected push is accepted, ARC-1
  returns error/incomplete (`accepted:true`, `verified:false`) because the bridge exposes no
  authoritative remote-commit postcondition.
- `switch_branch` and `create_branch` likewise return error/incomplete after acceptance: repository
  readback does not prove imported objects or activation.
- `unlink` succeeds only after repository absence is read back. A failed readback or still-present
  repository is error/incomplete.

For the latter incomplete outcomes, the mutation may already have happened. **Do not retry blindly**;
inspect the remote/repository state first. The latest postcondition hardening is adversarially unit
tested, but the final A4H pass sent no Git mutation and is not presented as final live verification.

**abapGit push** stages first, then commits the objects you select: ARC-1 calls the stage endpoint, keeps
the objects (with their file lists) that match `objects`, and sends them back with your `message`. Author
and committer come from the git user abapGit has stored for the repo, so no identity parameters are needed.
A push with no matching local change is reported as a no-op instead of an empty commit; a selected push
uses the accepted-but-incomplete contract above.

**Examples:**
```
SAPGit(action="list_repos")
SAPGit(action="whoami", backend="gcts")
SAPGit(action="config", backend="gcts")
SAPGit(action="history", backend="gcts", repoId="ZARC1", limit=20)
SAPGit(action="external_info", backend="abapgit", url="https://github.com/abapGit-tests/CLAS.git")
SAPGit(action="switch_branch", repoId="000000000006", branch="main", backend="abapgit")
SAPGit(action="clone", backend="abapgit", package="$TMP", url="https://github.com/org/repo.git")
SAPGit(action="clone", backend="abapgit", package="$TMP", url="https://github.com/org/private.git", token="ghp_…")
SAPGit(action="stage", backend="abapgit", repoId="000000000001")
SAPGit(action="push", backend="abapgit", repoId="000000000001", message="Add order validation")
```

## SAPContext

Get context-first understanding for an ABAP object, or look up reverse dependencies (who uses a given object).

Use this before `SAPRead` when the user asks what an existing class, interface, program, function module, or CDS view does, or before drafting a spec/change/review. `action="deps"` prepends the object's Knowledge Transfer Document (`SKTD`/`KTD`) when one exists, then returns compressed dependency contracts. Use `SAPRead` after that only when you need exact source, method-level detail, grep output, drafts, revisions, or metadata.

SAPContext has three modes controlled by the `action` parameter:

**Quick decision rule:**
- *"What breaks if I change `<CDS view>`?"* / *"Who consumes `I_*`?"* / *"Impact of `<DDLS>`"* → **`action="impact"`**
- *"What does `<object>` do?"* / *"Explain `<object>`"* / spec, review, or dependency context before editing → **`action="deps"`** (default)
- *"Who calls `<object>`?"* → **`action="usages"`** (live SAP where-used)

> **Do not** hand-roll CDS impact analysis by querying `DDDDLSRC`, `ACMDCLSRC`, `DDLXSRC_SRC`, or `SRVDSRC_SRC` via `SAPQuery`. Those text-scans produce substring-match noise and package group nodes. `action="impact"` uses SAP's where-used index and returns deduplicated, RAP-classified results.

### action="deps" (default) — Dependency context

Returns the target object's KTD first when available, followed by only the public API contracts (method signatures, interface definitions, type declarations) of all objects that the target depends on — NOT the full source code. Typical compression: 7-30x fewer tokens.

**What gets extracted per dependency:**
- **Classes:** `CLASS DEFINITION` with `PUBLIC SECTION` only. `PROTECTED`, `PRIVATE` sections and `CLASS IMPLEMENTATION` are stripped.
- **Interfaces:** Full interface definition (interfaces are already public contracts).
- **Function modules:** `FUNCTION` signature block only (`IMPORTING`/`EXPORTING` parameters). Function body is stripped.

**Filtering:** SAP standard objects (`CL_ABAP_*`, `IF_ABAP_*`, `CX_SY_*`) are excluded by default. Custom objects (`Z*`, `Y*`) are prioritized in the output.

**Dependency detection:** Uses `@abaplint/core` AST parsing to find `TYPE REF TO`, `NEW`, `CAST`, `INHERITING FROM`, `INTERFACES`, `CALL FUNCTION`, `RAISING`, `CATCH`, and static method calls (`=>`).

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | No | `"deps"` (default), `"usages"`, `"impact"`, or `"structure"` |
| `type` | string | Yes (for deps/structure), optional for impact/usages | Object type: `CLAS`, `INTF`, `PROG`, `FUNC`, `DDLS`, `TABL` |
| `name` | string | Yes | Object name (e.g., `ZCL_ORDER`) |
| `source` | string | No | Provide source directly instead of fetching from SAP |
| `includeKtd` | boolean | No | Only for `action="deps"`. Defaults to `true`; prepends the object's KTD (`SKTD`/`KTD`) when one exists. Set `false` to skip the KTD lookup. Ignored when `source` is supplied. |
| `group` | string | No | Required for `FUNC` type. The function group name. |
| `maxResults` | number | No | For `usages`: maximum entries (default 100); for `impact`: maximum per downstream bucket (default 50), hard max 1000. Totals remain uncapped counts. |
| `maxDeps` | number | No | Maximum dependencies to resolve (default 20) |
| `depth` | number | No | Dependency depth: 1 = direct only (default), 2 = deps of deps, 3 = max |
| `includeIndirect` | boolean | No | Only for `action="impact"` (DDLS): include indirect downstream where-used entries (default `false`) |
| `siblingCheck` | boolean | No | Only for `action="impact"`: run sibling metadata-extension consistency analysis (default `true`) |
| `siblingMaxCandidates` | number | No | Only for `action="impact"`: max sibling DDLS candidates to compare (default `4`, hard cap `10`) |

**Examples:**
```
SAPContext(type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER")
SAPContext(type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER", depth=2, maxDeps=10)
SAPContext(type="INTF", name="ZIF_ORDER", source="<already fetched source>")
SAPContext(action="deps", type="CLAS", name="ZCL_ORDER")
SAPContext(action="structure", type="TABL", name="BAPIRET2")
```

**Output format:**
```
* === Knowledge Transfer Document for ZCL_ORDER ===

# ZCL_ORDER

Business intent and object notes from the KTD.

* === Dependency context for ZCL_ORDER (3 deps resolved) ===

* --- ZIF_ORDER (intf, 4 methods) ---
INTERFACE zif_order PUBLIC.
  METHODS create IMPORTING order TYPE t_order.
  ...
ENDINTERFACE.

* --- ZCL_ITEM (clas, 3 methods) ---
CLASS zcl_item DEFINITION PUBLIC.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS get_price RETURNING VALUE(result) TYPE p.
    ...
ENDCLASS.

* Stats: 5 deps found, 3 resolved, 0 failed, 25 lines
```

If the object has no KTD or the backend returns 404/410 for the KTD document, ARC-1 silently omits the KTD section and still returns the dependency context. Other KTD read errors are surfaced normally.

**Cache indicator:** When the dependency graph is served from the hash-keyed dep-graph cache (no further ADT calls beyond the source revalidation), the header changes to:
```
* === Dependency context for ZCL_ORDER (3 deps resolved) [cached] ===
```

The `[cached]` label here is for **dependency graph hits** (hash-keyed, naturally correct without server validation). It is distinct from `[cached:revalidated]` which appears on `SAPRead` source responses after SAP confirms freshness via `304 Not Modified`. See [Caching System → Source freshness](caching.md#source-freshness) for details.

### action="structure" — DDIC includes + append structures (TABL only)

Returns a JSON tree for a DDIC structure or transparent table. ARC-1 parses embedded includes from the TABL source (`include <name>;`, named includes, and classic `.INCLUDE`) and resolves append/extension structures through ADT where-used. Append candidates are only returned after ARC-1 reads the candidate source and confirms it contains `extend type <base> with`; `.APPEND` is not parsed from the base source because ADT does not emit append structures there.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "ZMCP_SHR_STRU",
  "type": "TABL",
  "includeExtensions": true,
  "tree": {
    "structure": "ZMCP_SHR_STRU",
    "attribute": null,
    "kind": "root",
    "children": [
      { "structure": "ZMCP_SHR_STRU_INC", "attribute": null, "kind": "include", "children": [] },
      { "structure": "ZOK_S_APPEND", "attribute": null, "kind": "append", "children": [] }
    ]
  },
  "summary": {
    "totalNodes": 3,
    "includes": 1,
    "appends": 1,
    "cyclic": 0,
    "unresolved": 0,
    "truncated": 0
  }
}
```

### action="impact" — CDS upstream + downstream impact (DDLS only)

Returns a single JSON payload with:
- **upstream** dependencies from CDS AST extraction (`tables`, `views`, `associations`, `compositions`)
- **downstream** where-used consumers classified into RAP-relevant buckets (`projectionViews`, `bdefs`, `serviceDefinitions`, `serviceBindings`, `accessControls`, `metadataExtensions`, `abapConsumers`, `documentation`, etc.)
- **consistencyHints** (additive): human-readable hints when sibling DDLS variants in the same package have asymmetric DDLX coverage
- **siblingExtensionAnalysis** (additive): structured details about sibling candidate filtering and metadata-extension counts

Use this to answer: "If I change this CDS view, what breaks?"

**Example:**
```
SAPContext(action="impact", type="DDLS", name="ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT")
SAPContext(action="impact", type="DDLS", name="ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT", includeIndirect=true)
SAPContext(action="impact", type="DDLS", name="ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT", siblingCheck=false)
SAPContext(action="impact", type="DDLS", name="ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT", siblingMaxCandidates=6)
```

**Output (shape):**
```json
{
  "name": "ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT",
  "type": "DDLS",
  "upstream": {
    "tables": [{ "name": "ZTABL_ARC1_I33" }],
    "views": [],
    "associations": [],
    "compositions": []
  },
  "downstream": {
    "projectionViews": [{ "name": "ZI_ARC1_I33_PROJ", "type": "DDLS/DF" }],
    "bdefs": [],
    "serviceDefinitions": [],
    "serviceBindings": [],
    "accessControls": [],
    "metadataExtensions": [],
    "abapConsumers": [],
    "tables": [],
    "documentation": [],
    "other": [],
    "summary": { "total": 1, "direct": 1, "indirect": 0, "byBucket": { "projectionViews": 1 } }
  },
  "summary": { "upstreamCount": 1, "downstreamTotal": 1, "downstreamDirect": 1 },
  "consistencyHints": [
    "Possible sibling metadata-extension inconsistency: ..."
  ],
  "siblingExtensionAnalysis": {
    "stem": "ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT",
    "maxCandidates": 4,
    "consideredCandidates": 2,
    "checkedCandidates": [
      { "name": "ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT2", "packageName": "ZARC1", "metadataExtensions": 1, "downstreamTotal": 3 }
    ]
  }
}
```

Sibling analysis is best-effort and bounded. Any sibling-search or sibling where-used failures are returned as warnings while the primary impact result still succeeds.

### action="usages" — Reverse dependency lookup

Queries SAP's live where-used index for objects that depend on the target (i.e., "who calls/uses this?"). The lookup uses the current caller's SAP identity and works with memory, SQLite, or no cache. `SAPNavigate(action="references")` uses the same live lookup but returns the navigation-oriented result directly.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | Yes | `"usages"` |
| `name` | string | Yes | Object name to look up (e.g., `ZCL_ORDER`, `ZIF_ORDER`) |
| `type` | string | No | Object type. Recommended when known; otherwise ARC-1 performs exact-name resolution and continues only for one unambiguous match. |

**Example:**
```
SAPContext(action="usages", type="INTF", name="ZIF_ORDER")
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "name": "ZIF_ORDER",
  "resolvedObject": {
    "type": "INTF",
    "name": "ZIF_ORDER",
    "uri": "/sap/bc/adt/oo/interfaces/zif_order"
  },
  "usageCount": 3,
  "shown": 2,
  "truncated": false,
  "usages": [
    { "name": "ZCL_ORDER", "type": "CLAS/OC", "uri": "/sap/bc/adt/oo/classes/zcl_order" },
    { "name": "ZCL_ORDER_EXTENDED", "type": "CLAS/OC", "uri": "/sap/bc/adt/oo/classes/zcl_order_extended" }
  ],
  "source": "live",
  "fallbackUsed": false
}
```

`usages` is paged (`maxResults`, default 100, max 1000) because a where-used lookup on a common
object is unbounded — `CL_ABAP_TYPEDESCR` returns 6,644 references. **`usageCount` is the total
match count, not the page length** (`shown` is the page): a capped page must never under-report the
blast radius of a change. `SAPNavigate(action="references")` returns the same paged envelope under
`references`, and `SAPContext(action="impact")` caps each downstream bucket while `summary` keeps
the complete counts.

If exact name resolution finds multiple object types, ARC-1 returns a bounded candidate list and asks for `type` instead of guessing.

---

## SAPLint

Run local abaplint rules on ABAP source code. System-aware: auto-selects cloud or on-prem rules based on detected system type. For server-side checks (ATC, syntax check, unit tests), use SAPDiagnose instead.

In multi-target v1, only the offline `lint`, `lint_and_fix`, and `list_rules` actions are listed and
accepted. `format` and formatter-settings actions contact or modify SAP and remain unavailable.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | Yes | `lint`, `lint_and_fix`, `list_rules`, `format`, `get_formatter_settings`, or `set_formatter_settings` |
| `source` | string | No | ABAP source code (for `lint`, `lint_and_fix`, and `format`) |
| `name` | string | No | Object name (used for filename detection) |
| `indentation` | boolean | No | PrettyPrinter indentation toggle (for `set_formatter_settings`) |
| `style` | string | No | PrettyPrinter keyword style: `keywordUpper`, `keywordLower`, `keywordAuto`, or `none` (for `set_formatter_settings`) |
| `rules` | object | No | Rule overrides: `{ "rule_name": false }` to disable, `{ "rule_name": { "severity": "Warning" } }` to configure |

**Actions:**

- **`lint`** — Check ABAP source for issues. Returns errors and warnings with line/column positions.
- **`lint_and_fix`** — Lint + auto-fix all fixable issues (keyword case, obsolete statements, etc.). Returns the fixed source code alongside remaining unfixable issues.
- **`list_rules`** — List all available rules with current config (preset, enabled/disabled status, severity). No source needed.
- **`format`** — Pretty-print ABAP source via SAP ADT PrettyPrinter using the SAP system's global formatter settings. Returns formatted source text.
- **`get_formatter_settings`** — Read SAP global PrettyPrinter settings (indentation + keyword style).
- **`set_formatter_settings`** — Update SAP global PrettyPrinter settings. Provide at least one of `indentation` or `style`. Requires `write` scope and `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true`.

**System-Aware Presets:**

The lint rules auto-configure based on the detected SAP system:
- **BTP/Cloud**: `cloud_types` (Error), `strict_sql` (Error), `obsolete_statement` (Error) — enforces ABAP Cloud constraints
- **On-premise**: `cloud_types` (disabled), `obsolete_statement` (Warning) — more relaxed, allows classic ABAP

**Pre-Write Validation:**

When `--lint-before-write` is enabled (default: true), SAPWrite automatically runs a strict subset of lint rules before writing to SAP. Parser errors and cloud violations block the write. Style issues (keyword case, indentation) never block writes.

**Execution mode note:**

`lint`, `lint_and_fix`, and `list_rules` run locally in ARC-1. `format` and `*_formatter_settings` actions call the SAP system (ADT PrettyPrinter endpoints).

**Custom Configuration:**

Use `--abaplint-config /path/to/abaplint.jsonc` to load custom rules. The file uses the [abaplint config format](https://abaplint.org):

```jsonc
{
  // Override specific rules
  "rules": {
    "line_length": { "severity": "Error", "length": 80 },
    "abapdoc": true,           // re-enable a disabled rule
    "obsolete_statement": false // disable a rule
  },
  // Optional: override syntax version
  "syntax": { "version": "v757" }
}
```

Rules from the config file are merged on top of the auto-detected preset (cloud/on-prem). Per-call overrides via the `rules` parameter take precedence over the config file.

**Response shapes:**

- **`lint`** returns: `[{ rule, message, line, column, endLine, endColumn, severity }]`
- **`lint_and_fix`** returns: `{ fixedSource, appliedFixes, fixedRules, remainingIssues }` — use `fixedSource` as the corrected code
- **`list_rules`** returns: `{ preset, abapVersion, enabledRules, disabledRules, rules }` — shows active config
- **`format`** returns: plain text (formatted ABAP source)
- **`get_formatter_settings`** returns: `{ indentation, style }`
- **`set_formatter_settings`** returns: `{ indentation, style }` (effective merged settings)

**Examples:**
```
SAPLint(action="lint", source="DATA lv_test TYPE string.\nlv_test = 'hello'.")
SAPLint(action="lint_and_fix", source="data lv_x type i.\nadd 1 to lv_x.", name="ZCL_TEST")
SAPLint(action="list_rules")
SAPLint(action="format", source="report ztest. data lv type string.")
SAPLint(action="get_formatter_settings")
SAPLint(action="set_formatter_settings", style="keywordLower")
SAPLint(action="lint", source="...", rules={"line_length": {"severity": "Error", "length": 80}})
```

## SAPDiagnose

Server-side code analysis and runtime diagnostics: syntax check, ABAP unit tests, ATC checks, CDS
test-case scaffolding, active/inactive object state, short dumps (ST22), ABAP profiler trace
arming/list/analysis, SM02 messages, Gateway errors, the on-prem STUSERTRACE authorization trace, an
OData performance probe (`sap-statistics`), CDS Show-SQL, and ST05 trace control.

Multi-target v1 includes `atc` and `unittest` under the existing `read` scope. They do not mutate
repository objects, but they execute SAP workloads and may create transient worklists/results;
administrators can disable them with `SAP_DENY_ACTIONS`.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | Yes | `syntax`, `unittest`, `atc`, `atc_variants`, `cds_testcases`, `dumps`, `traces`, `trace_start`, `trace_requests`, `trace_cancel`, `system_messages`, `gateway_errors`, `object_state`, `quickfix`, `apply_quickfix`, `odata_perf`, `cds_sql`, `sql_trace_state`, `set_sql_trace_state`, `sql_trace_directory`, or `authorization_trace` |
| `name` | string | No | Object or package name (required for syntax/unittest/atc/object_state/quickfix/apply_quickfix; the CDS entity / DDLS source name for `cds_testcases` and `cds_sql`) |
| `url` | string | No | For `odata_perf`: the host-relative OData path to probe (from the Fiori app's Network tab), e.g. `/sap/opu/odata4/sap/.../Entity?$filter=...`. Must be a path on the SAP system ARC-1 connects to — absolute URLs are rejected. |
| `type` | string | No | Object type. `unittest` supports `CLAS`, `PROG`, `FUGR`, and `DEVC` (package); other actions accept their documented ADT types. |
| `sourceUri` | string | No | Exact ADT source URI for quickfix/apply_quickfix; defaults to the type/name main source. Use it for class-local includes. |
| `version` | string | No | For syntax: `active` (default) or `inactive`. |
| `coverage` | boolean | No | For `unittest`: also return statement/branch/procedure coverage for the object, plus `methodsBelowFull` (methods under 100% statement coverage, worst first), in one extra round-trip. Default false. |
| `includeSubpackages` | boolean | No | For `unittest` with `type="DEVC"`: include the package subtree. Default false selects only objects whose actual package is `name`. Rejected for other types/actions. |
| `resultFormat` | string | No | For `unittest`: `legacy` (default), `structured`, or `junit`; JUnit uses SAP's public asynchronous AUnit endpoint when available and otherwise generates JUnit from the legacy result. For `atc`: `legacy` or `structured`; `junit` is rejected because ATC JUnit output is not implemented. Other actions reject this parameter. Dedicated CLI checks choose their required format automatically. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | number | No | For `unittest` or `atc`: execution and verification budget; default `300`, range `1..3600`. Timeout is incomplete evidence, never a pass. |
| `source` | string | No | Current source code (required for `quickfix` and `apply_quickfix`) |
| `line` | number | No | Source line number (required for `quickfix` and `apply_quickfix`) |
| `column` | number | No | Source column number (optional for `quickfix` and `apply_quickfix`, default `0`) |
| `proposalUri` | string | No | Quickfix proposal URI from `quickfix` response (required for `apply_quickfix`) |
| `proposalUserContent` | string | No | Opaque proposal state from `quickfix` response (required for `apply_quickfix`) |
| `proposalAffectedObjects` | array | No | Optional affected-object rows returned by quickfix. Preserve each URI and include current content when applying a multi-object proposal. |
| `id` | string | No | Dump ID, profiler trace ID, or armed trace-request ID to cancel. Omit for list actions. |
| `detailUrl` | string | No | For Gateway-error detail: canonical host-relative `/sap/bc/adt/gw/errorlog/...` path. Absolute URLs, traversal, encoded separators, and non-canonical encodings are rejected. |
| `errorType` | string | No | Gateway error type required when requesting detail by `id` rather than `detailUrl`, e.g. `Frontend Error`. |
| `user` | string | No | SAP-user filter for dumps, runtime feeds, or `authorization_trace` |
| `authObject` | string | No | For `authorization_trace`: filter to one authorization object, for example `S_TCODE` |
| `from` | string | No | Lower time boundary for `system_messages`/`gateway_errors`. |
| `to` | string | No | Upper time boundary for `system_messages`/`gateway_errors`. |
| `onlyFailures` | boolean | No | For `authorization_trace`: return only denied checks (`RC <> 0`) |
| `maxResults` | number | No | Maximum results (default 50 for dumps/feeds, 100 for `authorization_trace`; safely capped) |
| `sections` | array | No | Dump chapter IDs for detail mode, e.g. `["kap0","kap3","kap8"]`; omit for focused defaults. |
| `includeFullText` | boolean | No | Dump detail only: include the full formatted text blob. Default false to limit tokens. |
| `variant` | string | No | ATC check variant name |
| `sqlOn` | boolean | No | For `set_sql_trace_state`: `true` arms the ST05 SQL trace, `false` disarms it (combine with `user` to filter to one SAP user) |
| `analysis` | string | No | For trace detail: `hitlist`, `statements`, or `dbAccesses` |
| `traceUser` | string | No | For `trace_start`/`trace_requests`: SAP user whose matching execution is traced/listed; defaults to the connected user. |
| `processType` | string | No | For `trace_start`: `any`, `http` (default), `dialog`, `batch`, or `rfc`. |
| `objectType` | string | No | For `trace_start`: `any`, `url`, `transaction`, `report`, or `functionModule`; inferred from `processType` when omitted. |
| `maxExecutions` | number | No | For `trace_start`: number of matching executions to capture (default 1). |
| `expiresHours` | number | No | For `trace_start`: hours until the armed request expires (default 24). |
| `sqlTrace` | boolean | No | For `trace_start`: capture SQL/DB accesses (default true; needed for `dbAccesses` analysis). |
| `aggregate` | boolean | No | For `trace_start`: aggregate the captured trace (default true). |
| `description` | string | No | Optional label for an armed trace request. |

**Actions:**

- **`syntax`** — Run SAP syntax check on an object. Returns errors/warnings with line, column, and message. **Important:** Syntax check runs against the *active* (on-system) source, not proposed new source. After writing/updating an object, activate it first, then run syntax check.
- **`unittest`** — Run ABAP unit tests for one `CLAS`, `PROG`, or `FUGR`, or for a whole `DEVC` package, with the maximum risk fixed to **harmless** (`dangerous=false`, `critical=false`) and all three duration categories enabled. Package scope is exact by default; `includeSubpackages=true` explicitly includes the subtree. Native JUnit uses SAP's package object set; legacy, coverage, and corroboration runs use the resolved executable roots. ARC-1 reads package membership and active source before and after the run. Changed membership/source, unreadable source, invalid object URIs, and the 1,000-row package-search bound are incomplete evidence, never a pass. Returns results per test class/method with status, alert messages, and execution time. Risk-level refusals are skipped/incomplete evidence, not passing tests. Pass `coverage=true` to also return **statement / branch / procedure** coverage (`{executed, total, percent}` each) plus **`methodsBelowFull`** — the methods under 100% statement coverage, worst first — via a second ADT round-trip to the coverage-measurement endpoint; the output becomes `{tests, coverage}`. Best-effort — if the coverage endpoint is unavailable the tests still return with a `coverageNote`. Use `resultFormat="structured"` for explicit outcome/completeness evidence or `resultFormat="junit"` for native/generated JUnit; the latter still reconciles public-endpoint results with a harmless legacy run so missing risk alerts cannot turn the result green.
- **`atc`** — Run ATC (ABAP Test Cockpit) checks. Returns findings with priority, check title, message, URI, line number, plus quickfix metadata (`quickfixInfo`, `hasQuickfix`). Optional `variant` parameter for custom check variants. **Omit it and ARC-1 binds the system's configured check variant** (`systemCheckVariant` from ATC customizing) — SAP itself maps an empty `checkVariant` to the Code Inspector variant literally named `DEFAULT`, which is usually not what the system is configured for. An unknown `variant` name is **rejected** rather than silently substituted (SAP would run `DEFAULT` and still return HTTP 200). `resultFormat="structured"` reports the variant actually bound plus `variantSource` (`requested` \| `systemDefault` \| `sapFallback`, the last meaning `/atc/customizing` was unavailable). On systems that expose asynchronous ATC runs, ARC-1 follows SAP's run-status resource to `Completed` before retrieving the worklist; unrecognized non-failure statuses keep polling rather than being mistaken for terminal failures. Older synchronous systems fall back to a ten-second quiet interval over the complete worklist response, excluding SAP's volatile root timestamp, so successful fallback settlement adds roughly ten seconds. Unsafe or missing asynchronous status locations are never followed; ARC-1 instead preserves any settled worklist findings but keeps the result incomplete. Failure and deadline paths make one best-effort final worklist read for the same reason. Structured results identify successful lifecycle evidence as `completionEvidence` (`asyncRunCompleted` \| `legacyWorklistSettled`) and expose `runStatus`. A synchronous `<worklistRun>` body can supply named informational `findingStatistics` (`errors`, `warnings`, `infos`, `total`) plus `runInfos`; modern asynchronous HTTP 201 responses have an empty body, so those fields are `null` and `[]`. The deprecated `expectedFindingCount` field remains an alias of `findingStatistics.total` for response compatibility, but does not drive `truncated` or `complete`. `truncated` is retained for compatibility and is `false` until SAP exposes a separate reliable truncation signal. `variantSource` may also be `"requestedUnverified"`, meaning you named a variant but the variant listing was unreachable, so ARC-1 could not confirm SAP honoured it. The default (non-`structured`) payload carries `findings`, `variant` and `variantSource`; incomplete default results are errors whose JSON body still contains any recovered findings. Use `resultFormat="structured"` when automation must distinguish a complete run from a missing/false object-set completeness marker, a zero-object result, malformed object/finding evidence, a cancelled/timed-out run, or a legacy worklist that has not settled.
- **`atc_variants`** — List the ATC check variants this system offers, plus the system default variant (the one `atc` binds when no `variant` is passed). Read-only. The `variant` parameter doubles as an optional name filter (`*` = all; e.g. `variant="ABAP_CLOUD*"`). Returns `{ systemDefault, filter, count, variants: [{ name, description }] }`. Use it to discover the exact `variant` string to pass to `action="atc"`.
- **`cds_testcases`** — Get SAP-suggested ABAP Unit test cases for a CDS entity (CDS Test Double Framework). Requires `name` (the CDS entity / DDLS source name; no `type`). Returns one suggestion per testable semantic — the whole view (`semanticType: "NONE"`), each calculated field (`"CALCULATION"` + `calculatedField`), and `"CAST"`/`"JOIN"`/`"CASE"` expressions — each with a suggested `testMethod` name + `description`, plus a `hint` for scaffolding a `cl_cds_test_environment` test class. **Read-only.** Available on **SAP_BASIS 8.16+ (ABAP Platform 2025 / S/4HANA 2025)** only — discovery-gated, so older releases return a clear "needs 8.16+" message. The AI-backed test-data / test-method *generation* (Joule for Developers) is intentionally **not** exposed.
- **`object_state`** — Compare active and inactive source versions for one object. For `CLAS`, ARC-1 checks main, definitions, implementations, macros, and testclasses includes (up to 10 parallel reads per class; sequence calls when sweeping many classes). Returns ETags, byte lengths, SHA-256 hashes, and divergence flags without returning full source. Useful for diagnosing activation failures where active and inactive class includes disagree.
- **`quickfix`** — Get SAP quickfix proposals for a specific source position (`name`, `type`, `source`, `line`, optional `column`). Returns proposal entries with `uri`, `type`, `name`, `description`, `userContent`.
- **`apply_quickfix`** — Apply one proposal (`proposalUri` + `proposalUserContent`) and return text deltas (range + replacement content). This does not write source; use `SAPWrite` to persist.
- **`dumps`** — List short dumps (ST22). Without `id`: returns recent dumps (filterable by `user`, `maxResults`). With `id`: returns full dump detail including error type, exception, program, stack trace, and formatted output.
- **`traces`** — List ABAP profiler traces. Without `id`: returns trace list. With `id` + `analysis`: returns trace analysis (`hitlist` = call hierarchy with hit counts and timings, `statements` = executed statements, `dbAccesses` = database access details).
- **`trace_start`** — Arm an ABAP profiler request for the next matching execution. Defaults to the next HTTP request by the connected user, with SQL capture on. This changes SAP trace-request state and needs `write` scope plus `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true`; reproduce the workload, then read it through `traces`.
- **`trace_requests`** — List armed profiler requests, optionally filtered by `traceUser`. Read-only.
- **`trace_cancel`** — Cancel one armed profiler request by `id`. Mutating; needs `write` scope plus `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true`.
- **`system_messages`** — List SM02 system messages, with optional `from`/`to`, `user`, and `maxResults` feed filters. Read-only.
- **`gateway_errors`** — List on-prem `/IWFND/ERROR_LOG` entries; request detail with the returned canonical `detailUrl`, or with `id` plus `errorType`. Read-only.
- **`odata_perf`** — Diagnose *why* a Fiori/OData request is slow. Pass `url` (the host-relative OData path from the app's Network tab); ARC-1 GETs it with `?sap-statistics=true` and a wall-clock timer, then returns the server-side timing split (`gwtotal`, `gwapp`, `gwappdb` = DB time, `gwfw`/`gwhub` = framework, `icfauth` = auth) plus a `verdict` routing you to the dominant cost (`db` → check the CDS query / `cds_sql` / ST05; `app` → ABAP profiler `traces`; `framework` → metadata/first-call; `auth` → ICF/DCL). Read-only GET; gated like data preview (`SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW`). The OData service must be on the same SAP host ARC-1 connects to. Older releases (e.g. NW 7.50) may report only a `gwhub` total without a per-component split → the verdict says so rather than guessing.
- **`authorization_trace`** — Read the long-term, on-prem **STUSERTRACE** trace from `SUAUTHVALTRC`, decode positional field values through `TOBJ`, and return the user, application, authorization object, result code, checked values, ABAP code location, and first-seen timestamp. Optional `user`, `authObject`, `onlyFailures`, and `maxResults` narrow the read; entries are sorted newest-first within the capped result set. Requires the `data` scope, `SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=true`, and SAP table-read authorization for `SUAUTHVALTRC` and `TOBJ`; it never needs free SQL. This is not SU53's live last-failure buffer: it contains only checks recorded while `auth/auth_user_trace` was enabled, and ARC-1 cannot toggle that profile parameter. Every response therefore reports `traceState.status="unknown"` and warns that persisted rows do not prove the trace is currently active; empty responses additionally include RZ11/profile activation guidance. Verify the current value in RZ11: `N` is inactive, `F` records only filters maintained in STUSERTRACE (recommended; at least one filter is required), and `Y` records all users/application types. A dynamic RZ11 change lasts until restart; select **Change on All Servers** when all application-server instances must participate, and maintain `DEFAULT.PFL` through the approved Basis profile workflow for a persistent setting. ABAP Cloud users should use the *Display Authorization Trace* Fiori app.
- **`cds_sql`** — Show the native SQL a CDS view compiles to (ADT "Show SQL Create Statement"). Pass `name` (the CDS DDL source / DDLS, e.g. `I_CURRENCY`). Returns the `CREATE VIEW` statement(s) — the joins/scans behind a slow entity. Read-only. Verified on NW 7.50, S/4HANA 2023 (758), and ABAP Platform 2025 (816); on 7.50 the statement is a classic DB `VIEW`.
- **`sql_trace_state`** — Read the current ST05 trace state (SQL/buffer/enqueue/RFC/HTTP/APC/AMC/auth on-off per application server, plus the active filter). Read-only.
- **`set_sql_trace_state`** — Arm or disarm the ST05 SQL trace. Requires `sqlOn` (`true` = arm, `false` = disarm); optional `user` filters the trace to one SAP user. Mutates server trace state → needs `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES`. Workflow: arm → reproduce the slow request → `sql_trace_directory` for the record-viewer link.
- **`sql_trace_directory`** — Return where the recorded SQL is read. ADT has no SQL-record endpoint; SAP answers `/st05/trace/directory` with the **Technical Monitoring Cockpit "SQL Trace Analysis" deep-link** — ARC-1 returns that URL (open it in a browser; needs the `/sap/bc/stmc` SICF service active). Read-only. *(The richer ADT-native record reader is the ABAP Cross Trace API — a planned follow-up.)*

### Quickfix Workflow

1. Run `SAPDiagnose(action="atc" ...)` or `SAPDiagnose(action="syntax" ...)`.
2. Check ATC findings for `hasQuickfix: true`.
3. Call `SAPDiagnose(action="quickfix", ...)` for the relevant line/column.
4. Select a proposal and call `SAPDiagnose(action="apply_quickfix", ...)` to receive deltas.
5. Apply those deltas to source and persist via `SAPWrite(action="update" | "edit_method", ...)`.

## SAPManage

Probe and report SAP system capabilities, inspect the object cache state, manage package (DEVC) and
classic FLP lifecycle operations, and set an object's API release contract.

**Actions:**
- `probe` — Re-probe the SAP system now (feature probes + auth checks + ADT discovery refresh). Detects optional features.
- `features` — Get cached feature status from last probe (fast, no SAP round-trip).
- `cache_stats` — Return request-driven cache statistics: cached sources, dependency graphs, released APIs, and the per-username inactive-list session cache (`inactiveListCache.userCount`, `inactiveListCache.totalEntries`).
- `create_package` — Create a package (`DEVC`) via `/sap/bc/adt/packages`.
- `delete_package` — Delete a package via lock/delete/unlock.
- `change_package` — Move an existing object into a different package (DEVC reassignment).
- `set_api_state` — Set one supported API release contract to `RELEASED` or `NOT_RELEASED`. ARC-1
  reads the contract, transforms only its writable subset, writes it, then reads it back. Supported
  contracts and visibility defaults come from SAP and are not broadened by ARC-1.
- `flp_list_catalogs` — List FLP designer catalogs. The `flp_*` actions target the classic tile/target-mapping model, deprecated as of S/4HANA 2023 and not federated by Work Zone content exposure v2 — the successor is the Launchpad App Descriptor Item (`SAPRead type=UIAD`). Business catalogs are a separate model (`/UI2/FLPCM_CUST`) and are not managed here.
- `flp_list_groups` — List FLP groups (`Pages`) from `/UI2/FLPD_CATALOG`.
- `flp_list_tiles` — List tiles/target mappings in a catalog.
- `flp_create_catalog` — Create an FLP designer catalog.
- `flp_create_group` — Create an FLP group.
- `flp_create_tile` — Create a tile in an FLP catalog.
- `flp_add_tile_to_group` — Assign a catalog tile instance into a group.
- `flp_delete_catalog` — Delete an FLP designer catalog.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | Yes | `probe`, `features`, `cache_stats`, `create_package`, `delete_package`, `change_package`, `set_api_state`, `flp_list_catalogs`, `flp_list_groups`, `flp_list_tiles`, `flp_create_catalog`, `flp_create_group`, `flp_create_tile`, `flp_add_tile_to_group`, `flp_delete_catalog` |
| `name` | string | No | Required for `create_package` and `delete_package` (package name) |
| `description` | string | No | Required for `create_package` (package description) |
| `superPackage` | string | No | Optional parent package for `create_package` (use `$TMP` for local packages) |
| `softwareComponent` | string | No | Optional software component for `create_package` (default: `LOCAL`) |
| `responsible` | string | No | Package-responsible ABAP user (XUBNAME, max 12 characters). Defaults to the connection user; pass explicitly under principal propagation. SAP rejects email identities here. |
| `transportLayer` | string | No | Optional transport layer for `create_package` |
| `recordChanges` | boolean | No | Whether the new package records object changes in transports. The default follows software-component/transport-layer context; literal LOCAL packages default false. |
| `packageType` | string | No | Optional package type for `create_package`: `development`, `structure`, `main` (default: `development`) |
| `transport` | string | No | Optional transport request ID (`corrNr`) for `create_package`/`delete_package`/`change_package` |
| `objectName` | string | No | Required for `change_package` — name of the object to move (e.g., `ZCL_MY_CLASS`) |
| `objectType` | string | No | Required for `change_package` — ADT object type (e.g., `CLAS/OC`, `DDLS/DF`, `PROG/P`) |
| `objectUri` | string | No | Optional for `change_package` — ADT URI of the object. Auto-resolved from objectName + objectType if not provided |
| `oldPackage` | string | No | Required for `change_package` — current package of the object |
| `newPackage` | string | No | Required for `change_package` — target package to move the object to |
| `apiState` | string | No | For `set_api_state`: `RELEASED` (default) or `NOT_RELEASED`; visibility follows SAP's contract defaults. |
| `contract` | string | No | For `set_api_state`: `C0`–`C4` (default `C1`). Support varies by type/release; inspect `SAPRead(type="API_STATE")` and SAP's supported-contract response. |
| `catalogId` | string | No | Required for `flp_list_tiles`, `flp_create_tile`, `flp_add_tile_to_group` |
| `groupId` | string | No | Required for `flp_create_group`, `flp_add_tile_to_group` |
| `domainId` | string | No | Required for `flp_create_catalog` |
| `title` | string | No | Required for `flp_create_catalog`, `flp_create_group` |
| `tileInstanceId` | string | No | Required for `flp_add_tile_to_group` |
| `tile` | object | No | Required for `flp_create_tile`. Fields: `id`, `title`, `semanticObject`, `semanticAction`, optional `icon`, `url`, `subtitle`, `info` |

**Probed features:** `hana`, `abapGit`, `rap`, `amdp`, `ui5`, `transport`, `ui5repo`, `flp`. Each returns `available` (bool), `mode` (auto/on/off), `message`, and `probedAt` timestamp.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Whether caching is active (`false` if `ARC1_CACHE=none`) |
| `sourceCount` | Cached source code entries (grows as objects are read) |
| `contractCount` | Cached dependency graphs (grows as `SAPContext(deps)` is called) |
| `apiCount` | Released API metadata entries populated by requests |
| `inactiveListCache` | Aggregate user/session draft-list cache counts |

**Examples:**
```
SAPManage(action="probe")       → discover system capabilities
SAPManage(action="features")    → get cached results (no SAP call)
SAPManage(action="cache_stats") → check request-driven cache state
SAPManage(action="create_package", name="ZRAP_TRAVEL", description="RAP Travel Demo")
SAPManage(action="create_package", name="ZRAP_TRAVEL", description="RAP Travel Demo", superPackage="ZRAP", softwareComponent="HOME", transportLayer="HOME", packageType="development", transport="K900123")
SAPManage(action="delete_package", name="ZRAP_TRAVEL")
SAPManage(action="change_package", objectName="ZCL_MY_CLASS", objectType="CLAS/OC", oldPackage="$TMP", newPackage="Z_PRODUCTION", transport="K900123")
SAPManage(action="set_api_state", name="ZCL_MY_CLASS", objectType="CLAS", contract="C1", apiState="RELEASED")
SAPManage(action="flp_list_catalogs")
SAPManage(action="flp_list_groups")
SAPManage(action="flp_list_tiles", catalogId="ZARC1_SALES")
SAPManage(action="flp_create_catalog", domainId="ZARC1_SALES", title="Sales Catalog")
SAPManage(action="flp_create_group", groupId="ZARC1_SALES_GRP", title="Sales Group")
SAPManage(action="flp_create_tile", catalogId="ZARC1_SALES", tile={"id":"tile_sales","title":"Sales","semanticObject":"SalesOrder","semanticAction":"display"})
SAPManage(action="flp_add_tile_to_group", groupId="ZARC1_SALES_GRP", catalogId="ZARC1_SALES", tileInstanceId="00O2TO3741QLWH4GV74AHMWQE")
```

**Note:** The `probe`, `features`, and `cache_stats` actions are read operations that work without `--allow-writes` and require only `read` scope in HTTP auth mode. Mutating SAPManage actions require `write` scope and writable safety config.
